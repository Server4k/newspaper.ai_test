        "news": "Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has raised skepticism about Ola Electric's recent claim of resolving 99.1% of customer complaints.  This follows the company's response to a Show Cause Notice from the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) regarding alleged misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices.  Kamra's tweet questioned the company's claim, suggesting that the high resolution rate doesn't reflect the reality of customer experiences.  \n\nKamra's criticism comes amidst ongoing public scrutiny of Ola Electric's after-sales service and repair delays. The company's stock price fell by 6% following the CCPA's notice.  While Ola Electric maintains a \"robust mechanism\" for handling complaints,  Kamra's continued criticism highlights the public's ongoing concerns.  The CCPA will verify Ola's claims, but the debate on social media highlights the challenge for Ola Electric to regain customer trust."

This surpasses the previous record held by Australian batsman Travis Head, who scored 200 off 114 balls, and Chennai Super Kings batsman Narayan Jagadeesan, who also achieved the feat in 114 balls.\n\nBowes' blistering innings included 7 sixes and 27 fours, showcasing his aggressive approach against both pace and spin bowling.

Having started his career in South Africa, he moved to Canterbury and even captained the South Africa U19 team in the 2012 World Cup, the same tournament in which Travis Head represented Australia. Former Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming played a key role in Bowes' career, helping him join the Sydenham Cricket Club in Christchurch. \n\nBowes' incredible performance not only broke a world record but also stands as the second-highest individual score in the Ford Trophy, just short of the record 222 set by former Black Caps batsman Jamie How in 2013."

This move comes as the South Korean tech giant seeks to stay ahead of the curve in the foldable phone market. \n\nHuawei's Mate XT Ultimate Edition, released in China, is a tri-fold device with a CNY 19,999 price tag (roughly Rs. 2,37,000). This device has reportedly prompted Samsung to accelerate their tri-fold development. \n\nOther smartphone brands like Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo are also rumored to be working on tri-fold devices, but Samsung sees innovation as crucial to maintaining their dominant position in the foldable phone market. \n\nAccording to ZDNet Korea, Samsung is developing two foldable phones: an entry-level clamshell model and a more advanced tri-fold model. While the components for the tri-fold model are reportedly complete, the final launch decision rests with Samsung Electronics\u2019 MX division.\n\nHowever, the foldable phone market has not yet lived up to expectations, with sales falling short. Reports suggest that orders for foldable phone OLED displays dropped 10% compared to last year. This trend is attributed to lower-than-expected demand for Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6, prompting the company to reduce display production.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time rumors of Samsung\u2019s tri-fold ambitions surfaced. In March 2023, speculation emerged that Samsung might skip launching the Galaxy S23 FE in favor of a tri-fold device. While the S23 FE was later released, Samsung's continued experimentation with tri-fold designs is evident.\n\nIf Samsung launches a tri-fold phone, it could significantly impact consumer expectations for foldable devices, potentially appealing to users seeking a flexible and advanced mobile experience. However, with Huawei already in the market, Samsung will need to offer a truly innovative product to remain competitive."

        "news": "Protests erupted in Bangladesh on Tuesday, October 22, demanding the resignation of President Mohammed Shahabuddin. The unrest stems from his comments on the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In an interview last week, the president stated he lacked documentary evidence of Hasina's resignation before she fled the country on August 5, 2024, amidst student-led protests.\n\nHundreds of protesters attempted to storm the presidential palace, leading to clashes with police who used sound grenades and even fired shots to contain the crowds. The military intervened and urged the protesters to leave.\n\nThe Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, a key player in Hasina's removal, is leading the charge for the president's resignation. They have issued a five-point demand, including the scrapping of the 1972 constitution.\n\nThe interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has been criticized for failing to provide concrete evidence of Hasina's resignation. Law affairs adviser Asif Nazrul has accused the president of \"falsehood\" and suggested his position may be in jeopardy. \n\nMeanwhile, the president has urged the public not to reignite controversy over a \"settled issue,\" maintaining that the interim government's legitimacy is supported by a Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe situation in Bangladesh remains tense, with the protests raising significant questions about the future of the country's political landscape."

        "news": "India's ambitious goal of producing 1.1 metric tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 may fall short, according to a new analysis by BloombergNEF. While the country has already tendered production capacity representing over 20% of this target, most investment proposals haven't reached the crucial stage of signing binding offtake contracts. This delay, coupled with the lack of green hydrogen consumption mandates in industries, forecasts a significantly lower production capacity of only 0.5 Mt/year by 2030, based on current project progress. \n\nThe analysis further reveals that green hydrogen production costs in India currently range from $3-5 per kilogram, with potential federal subsidies reducing costs by 70 cents.  States like Uttar Pradesh offer generous incentives, potentially pushing costs down to $2/kg. This cost competitiveness makes green hydrogen a viable alternative to grey hydrogen, particularly for petroleum refineries. \n\nWhile most offtake agreements signed rely on exporting the clean fuel to advanced economies like Europe and Japan, the lack of strong local demand highlights the need for developing a mature domestic market.  The export route, however, offers an opportunity for green hydrogen producers to achieve economies of scale and lower production costs."

Its popularity declined in the late 1990s due to music piracy and the rise of digital streaming. While the store\u2019s original owners, the Curmally family, sold it to Modi in 2017, its closure marked a symbolic shift in music consumption trends.\n\nBhaane has confirmed the purchase and plans to expand its retail presence in Mumbai.

In May 2023, a 23-year-old tech professional tragically lost her life when her car was submerged at an underpass near K.R. Circle, sparking outrage and criticism of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for its lack of proactive measures.\n\nDespite the tragedy, several underpasses across the city continue to flood during heavy rains, including those at Okalipuram, Panathur, and Madiwala Ayyappa Temple.  While the BBMP has implemented some temporary measures, like closing underpasses during heavy rainfall, these have been deemed insufficient. Experts point to the design flaws of these structures, particularly U-shaped underpasses, as the root cause of the problem. The lack of proper drainage systems and steep approach ramps contribute to the rapid accumulation of water, rendering these underpasses dangerous even during moderate rainfall.\n\nThe BBMP has proposed some remedial actions, including covering the roofs of U-shaped underpasses with galvanised sheets and desilting drains. While these steps are being implemented, experts argue that a more comprehensive approach is needed to address the underlying issues. This includes improving drainage infrastructure, redesigning underpasses with less steep ramps, and implementing a more robust maintenance schedule. \n\nThe continued flooding of Bengaluru's underpasses poses a serious risk to public safety. The city authorities need to address this issue with a holistic approach, ensuring the safety and well-being of its citizens."

The incident, which resulted in damage to hospital property including glass panes, stemmed from a dispute over flag hoisting at Cochin College.\n\nThe KSU accused SFI members of instigating violence at the hospital and attacking their members, while SFI blamed the KSU for the incident. The conflict escalated after SFI members allegedly refused to remove their flag from the college campus, where the KSU had recently won the college union election after six years. \n\nThe KSU subsequently hoisted its flag, leading to clashes between the two groups. The violence spread from the college campus to the hospital, resulting in a tense situation."

The protest follows the NHAI\u2019s refusal to grant the exemption requested by the Ernakulam District Collector. \n\nThe residents are facing a significant inconvenience due to the closure of the Kundannoor and Alexander Parambithara bridges, which are undergoing resurfacing work. These bridges provide vital access to areas like Maradu and Kundannoor, connecting them to Willingdon Island and West Kochi. The closure forces commuters to take a detour through the toll plaza, adding an extra 10 kilometers to their journey.\n\nThe Maradu municipality, led by chairman Antony Ashanparambil, argues that the NHAI\u2019s decision to deny the exemption is aimed at hindering the Collector\u2019s request. They urged the NHAI to reconsider their stance and provide temporary relief for residents during the bridge closure period. \n\nThe protest was temporarily suspended on the assurance that the issue would be escalated to higher authorities within the NHAI. Meanwhile, the Public Works Department (NH wing) is tasked with expediting the resurfacing work to minimize the inconvenience caused to the public."

However, the site faces a looming threat from nearby quarrying operations, raising concerns about the preservation of this valuable historical landmark.\n\nThe discovery was made by researchers from the Madurai Nature Cultural Foundation (MNCF) who documented the beds, which, unlike other Jain sites in the area, lack traditional inscriptions and sculptures.  Though the beds have been noted by locals, their significance was previously overlooked. \n\nThe MNCF is now advocating for the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology to declare the site a protected area, arguing that the site is not only historically important but also holds potential for boosting tourism in the region. Currently, many other Jain sites in the district, such as those in Keelavalavu, Thiruvathavur, Varichiyur, and Karungalakkudi, remain largely unknown to tourists.\n\nThe presence of quarrying operations poses a significant threat to the preservation of these beds.

It also serves as a reminder that even the most powerful parties are not immune to scrutiny and legal challenges."

        "news": "India and Pakistan have agreed to extend their agreement on the Kartarpur Corridor for another five years, until 2029. The corridor, opened in 2019, allows Sikh pilgrims from India to visit the sacred Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, where Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, spent his final days.\n\nThe renewal comes despite strained relations between the two countries. India has, however, expressed its disappointment that Pakistan continues to levy a $20 service charge per pilgrim, a fee India has urged be waived.\n\nWhile the agreement signifies a continued channel of communication, India's efforts to convince Pakistan to remove the service charge have been unsuccessful. Pakistan maintains that the charge is necessary to cover the cost of refurbishing the Gurdwara and the construction of infrastructure for pilgrims.\n\nThe corridor has seen a decline in the number of pilgrims since its opening, despite the daily quota of 5,000 pilgrims set by Pakistan."

        "news": "Coral, a seemingly simple marine invertebrate, played a surprisingly significant role in the economic history of Madras (now Chennai) during the 17th and 18th centuries. While the city's Sephardic Jewish merchants were known for trading in various precious stones, coral stands out as a key commodity that shaped their business interests and left its mark on the city's geography.\n\nThe red coral, sourced from the Mediterranean, was highly prized in India since Roman times. This demand intensified under colonial rule, with European traders recognizing a lucrative opportunity. Portuguese Jewish dealers in London established a network to supply vast quantities of coral to Madras, where it was traded for diamonds destined for Europe. \n\nCoral's influence went beyond mere trade. Historical records indicate that it played a critical role in the wealth and power struggles of prominent figures. Samudra Mudali, a prominent official, amassed his fortune through a clandestine coral sale, while Governor Dupleix sought information on coral stock and prices. George, Lord Pigot, a notoriously corrupt governor, even secured a commission on coral sales, which became a source of conflict and ultimately contributed to his downfall.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the immense demand for coral are not entirely clear, its use in jewelry and as an ingredient in aphrodisiacs is widely documented. By the 19th century, coral's prominence began to wane, eventually becoming just another component in ornaments. \n\nDespite its eventual decline, coral\u2019s influence on Madras\u2019s economy, its role in shaping the lives of key historical figures, and its lasting impact on the city\u2019s geography remain intriguing testaments to its unique place in the city's history."

These seats are scheduled for polls in the second phase, which will take place on November 20.\n\nThe announcement comes as the CPI(ML)'s negotiations with the JMM and Congress,  part of the INDIA alliance, for seat-sharing have hit a standstill. The CPI(ML) had initially expressed interest in contesting 12 seats but are now willing to settle for five. However, the JMM has been reluctant to concede Dhanwar, a seat the CPI(ML) has held since 1995.\n\nThe CPI(ML) is confident in its chances in these three seats, claiming to have outperformed the JMM-Congress alliance in the 2019 elections. The party is particularly strong in Nirsa and Sindri, where the Marxist Coordination Committee (MCC), which has now merged with the CPI(ML), has a substantial presence.\n\nThe CPI(ML) is yet to finalize its candidate for the Bagodar constituency, where their sitting MLA, Vinod Singh, is seeking re-election.

It provides India with a significant standoff capability, enabling the launch of nuclear weapons from within its territorial waters. This strengthens India's \"Credible Minimum Deterrence\" (CMD) strategy, a policy emphasizing a robust and survivable retaliatory capacity while maintaining a \"No First Use\" commitment to nuclear weapons.\n\nThe S4* is the latest addition to India's growing nuclear submarine fleet. The first SSBN, INS Arihant, was commissioned in 2016. It is equipped with the K-15 SLBM with a range of 750km. The second SSBN, INS Arighaat, was commissioned in August of this year, while the third, Aridhman, is undergoing sea trials.\n\nThe launch of the S4* marks a significant step forward in India's nuclear capabilities and signals the nation's commitment to a robust deterrence strategy. It is expected to play a vital role in maintaining regional stability and projecting India's growing power in the Indo-Pacific region."

Doctors in Chennai have shared their perspectives on the complexities involved, with particular focus on the presence of partners in labor and delivery rooms.\n\nDr. Kanimozhi N.V.N. Somu, a physician and Rajya Sabha Member, emphasizes that there's no set rule regarding a husband's presence in the delivery room. The decision rests primarily with the doctor and hospital management, with increasing acceptance of husbands being present for vaginal deliveries.  However, for cesarean sections, the decision remains at the discretion of the medical team due to the sterile environment and potential for distraction.\n\nDr. Jaishree Gajaraj, a senior consultant obstetrician and gynecologist, shares a similar viewpoint, stating that while many doctors allow husbands in the labor room, she personally prefers to limit their presence in the operating room due to potential distraction.  She suggests that allowing partners during Cesareans under spinal anesthesia is acceptable, as the mother is awake and can maintain privacy. However, if a woman is under general anesthesia, only medical personnel should be present. \n\nOther doctors have noted that while some hospitals permit husbands to cut the umbilical cord during vaginal deliveries, this should always be at the request of the mother.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Irfan's video also highlights the need for clear protocols regarding video recording and posting on social media. Dr. Kanimozhi underscores that while husbands are present to provide support, they should not be recording and sharing sensitive medical procedures without proper consent.  Dr. Jaishree emphasizes the need for consent from both hospital management and the surgeon involved.\n\nAll doctors stress the importance of maintaining a sterile environment in the operating room, and highlight the potential risks of infection if proper hygiene protocols are not followed.  Dr. Vijaya, president of the Obstetric and Gynaecological Society of Southern India, reiterates that non-medical personnel should never be allowed in the operating room, particularly during Cesarean sections, where the uterus is open. \n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining patient privacy, respecting the sterile environment of operating rooms, and adhering to clear protocols for video recording in medical settings."

The report, commissioned by the Ramsar Bureau-East Asia, identifies escalating urbanisation, rising salinity levels, excessive agrochemical use, mangrove decline, and contamination as key threats.\n\nUrban encroachment has significantly increased in the past two decades, particularly in Puzhakal, Cherpu, and Irinjalakuda.  The study predicts that a sea level rise of 0.5 meters, linked to global warming, could inundate three-quarters of the wetland if preventive measures are not taken. The salinity model identifies Mullesary, Cherpu, and Irinjalakuda as highly vulnerable. \n\nWhile crop production is projected to increase slightly by 2030, it is expected to decline significantly by 2060. The study warns that areas with significant mangrove cover, vital for carbon sequestration, will diminish if salinity exceeds 18 ppt in Chetuva and Idianchira. Untreated sewage from Thrissur Corporation and Irinjalakuda Municipality has also compromised water quality in nearby open wells.\n\nThe report urges immediate action, including a comprehensive scientific operational policy for the Chimoni reservoir to address irrigation needs. It also emphasizes the urgent need to repair and maintain regulators and barrages at Enamakkal and Idianchira.\n\nExperts stress the importance of planning adaptive measures to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, developing climate-resilient crop species, and forming regional farmer groups to enhance procurement and marketing of agricultural products. They also advocate for continuous monitoring and an early warning system to safeguard the Kole wetlands, a critical biodiversity hotspot, from further climate change impacts."

S. Pushparaj, Associate Professor and Head of Department of Econometrics at MKU, boycotted the event, citing the Governor's alleged violation of state traditions and norms.
