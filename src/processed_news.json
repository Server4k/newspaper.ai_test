However, initial signs suggest a flat listing, with the grey market premium indicating minimal gains for investors. \n\nThe IPO, which ran from October 15th to 17th, offered shares at a price range of Rs 1,865-1,960 per share. The issue, primarily an offer-for-sale by its South Korean parent company, raised approximately Rs 27,856 crore.\n\nDespite strong market positioning in India, the IPO saw muted bidding, subscribed only 2.37 times. This underperformance can be attributed to concerns about high valuations relative to peers and a 100% offer-for-sale component, leaving no fresh capital for the company. \n\nWhile some analysts predict a listing price around Rs 2,035,  the subdued grey market premium points towards a flat or even negative debut. \n\nDespite the potential for short-term volatility, experts suggest a long-term holding strategy, citing Hyundai's strong growth potential, robust financials, and focus on electric vehicles."

The redeployment, which began in 2016 due to the university\u2019s financial crisis, has seen over 1,000 faculty members transferred on a three-year deputation basis. \n\nThe TNGCTA argues that the extended deputation, now lasting nine years, has denied opportunities to qualified job aspirants who are entitled to positions based on social justice principles. The association claims that the redeployed staff were not appointed following the state\u2019s reservation system and should be replaced by candidates selected through the standard appointment process. \n\nFurthermore, the TNGCTA proposes that the redeployed staff could be integrated into vacant positions within state universities instead of becoming permanent fixtures in government colleges.

        "news": "The resignation of BJP MLC C.P. Yogeshwar and his potential independent candidacy in the Channapatna bypolls has created a significant strain on the NDA alliance in Karnataka, where the Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)) is a partner. \n\nYogeshwar's announcement, which comes in the wake of Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy's resignation from the Channapatna seat, has left the JD(S) in a difficult position. While Yogeshwar has hinted at seeking the JD(S) ticket, local JD(S) leaders fear that a three-way contest with him as an independent could benefit the Congress. They believe that a direct contest between Yogeshwar as a BJP candidate and a Congress candidate would hurt the JD(S)'s base. \n\nThis issue has been simmering within the alliance for some time, but came to a head when Kumaraswamy accused some BJP leaders of trying to undermine the alliance with Congress help.  \n\nFurther complicating matters, while BJP President J.P. Nadda reportedly offered Yogeshwar a JD(S) ticket, he has reportedly refused, hoping to retain support among Muslim and backward class voters. This has led to disagreement within the JD(S) local leadership, who oppose Yogeshwar contesting on a BJP ticket. Former Chief Minister and BJP leader B.S. Yediyurappa has also stated that Channapatna is a JD(S) seat.\n\nThe JD(S) is currently holding meetings to discuss the situation and will consult with party workers in Channapatna before announcing their decision on a candidate. \n\nThe Congress, meanwhile, has denied offering Yogeshwar a ticket, although sources suggest that informal discussions have taken place.  \n\nThe Channapatna bypolls have become a crucial test for the NDA alliance in Karnataka, with the outcome potentially impacting the political landscape in the state."

To mitigate this risk, the Chennai Corporation, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), and other local bodies will implement new development regulations.\n\nThese regulations will provide residents and developers with crucial information to ensure flood-proof building construction. Specifically, the guidance will include the appropriate plinth level, the elevation of the building's base, based on the flood risk assessment. This ensures buildings are constructed above the potential floodwater level.\n\nThe new regulations are currently being finalized and will be implemented after review by senior officials this week. This initiative is a significant step towards enhancing flood resilience in Chennai, a city prone to flooding during monsoon season."

The petitioners argued that these additions, made in 1976, were unconstitutional and infringed upon individual liberties.\n\nThe court, however, dismissed these arguments, stating that secularism has been consistently recognized as a core principle since India's independence. The court pointed to the Constitution's emphasis on equality and fraternity as evidence of this inherent commitment to secularism. \n\nThe court also addressed the petitioners' concerns about the term \"socialist\", clarifying that it does not necessarily imply a Western model of socialism but rather promotes equality of opportunity and equitable distribution of national wealth. \n\nThis ruling reinforces the Supreme Court's longstanding position on secularism, highlighting its central role in safeguarding India's diverse society and ensuring the rights of all citizens."

This initiative, part of the Saudi government's Global Harmony Initiative, showcased India's diversity and pluralism through music, food, and performances by Indian artists and athletes.\n\nThe event, held at Suwaidi Park, drew large crowds of Saudis and South Asians, highlighting the significant Indian community in the Kingdom. With 2.4 million expat workers, India boasts the second-largest foreign workforce in Saudi Arabia, following Bangladesh with nearly 2.7 million. The Saudi government has implemented measures to ensure safe and fair working conditions for foreign workers, including wage protection systems and employer background checks.\n\nBeyond cultural exchange, the event highlighted Saudi Arabia's economic diversification and its potential as a regional tourism hub. The government showcased ongoing environmental conservation projects and promoted lesser-known tourist destinations, including the Red Sea coast and ancient trade routes. These attractions are anticipated to draw tourists from India in the future.\n\nThe Indian cultural festival culminated on October 21st with cricketer Sreesanth as the guest of honor. The event underscored the ongoing social and cultural transformations taking place in Saudi Arabia, reflected in the widespread participation of Saudi women across various aspects of the festivities.\n\nThe Riyadh Season, which focuses on the pace of change in Saudi society, will be followed by a Saudi exhibition on innovation, technologies, infrastructure, and services in early November. These events reflect Saudi Arabia's commitment to international engagement, particularly with India, as both countries navigate regional and global challenges. This includes efforts to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, tensions between Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia's diplomatic outreach to India."

        "news": "Butterfly enthusiasts in the Nilgiris have made a significant discovery: the Nilgiri tit butterfly (Hypolycaena nilgirica) uses a large terrestrial orchid plant, *Eulophia epidendraea*, as a host. This is the first recorded instance of this species utilizing this specific plant in India. \n\nThe study, published in the scientific journal \"The Tropical Lepidoptera,\" was conducted by Manoj Sethumadhavan, Felix Nirmal Dev, Vinod Sriramulu, and Selvaraj Jeevith near the Kallar horticultural garden. The discovery holds immense importance for the conservation of this rare, endemic butterfly, classified under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act.\n\nPreviously, the Nilgiri tit was known to exist in the Nilgiris and Sri Lanka.  While sightings were recorded in various parts of the Western Ghats, this recent discovery sheds light on the butterfly's specific habitat preferences and reproductive behavior.\n\nThe researchers observed that the Nilgiri tit lays its eggs on the inflorescence of the *Eulophia epidendraea*, indicating a strong connection between the butterfly and this particular orchid species. Further research is anticipated to better understand the life cycle of this unique species, as well as its relationship with the surrounding flora and fauna."

        "news": "A decade after the formation of Telangana, the Union Home Ministry is calling for a meeting with the state's Chief Secretary to discuss the implementation of educational and infrastructure projects promised under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act (APRA) of 2014. \n\nThe meeting comes amidst growing frustration in Telangana regarding the lack of progress on several key projects outlined in Schedule XIII of the APRA. The central government's commitments include establishing a Tribal University and a Horticulture University, studying the feasibility of an integrated steel plant in Khammam district, and improving road connectivity in the state's backward regions.\n\nHowever, the progress on these projects has been slow, with several facing delays or outright cancellations. The proposed steel plant has been shelved due to economic viability concerns. The rail coach factory has been scaled down to a periodical overhauling workshop despite repeated requests from the state government. \n\nThe situation regarding the Tribal University is particularly concerning. While a gazette notification was issued in December 2023, nine and a half years after the assurance was made, there is no guarantee on the funding allocated for the university. In contrast, the central government has already released \u20b9400 crore of the \u20b9825 crore sanctioned for a similar university in Andhra Pradesh. \n\nThe meeting, which will be chaired by the Union Home Secretary, will be attended by secretaries of key ministries including Higher Education, Agriculture, Steel, Coal and Power. This meeting is crucial to bridge the gap between promises made and actions taken, and address the concerns raised by Telangana."
