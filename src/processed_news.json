Data from the State Crime Records Division shows a disturbing trend: 88 cases in 2021, rising to 102 in 2022, and reaching a concerning 144 in 2023. \n\nBengaluru city reported the highest number of cases in 2023 with 15, followed by Hassan (11 cases) and Udupi (10 cases). Shivamogga and Dakshina Kannada recorded 8 and 7 cases respectively.\n\nOdanadi Seva Samsthe, a Mysuru-based NGO working to rescue and rehabilitate victims of sexual exploitation, expresses deep concern over these rising numbers.  Founder Director M.L. Parashuram believes the actual number of cases could be much higher, as many boys remain silent about their abuse. \n\nThis silence is highlighted by the compensation scheme of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA), which shows significantly higher compensation claims from minor girls compared to boys. While 219 minor girls received compensation in 2020-21, only 187 and 178 received it in 2021-22 and 2022-23 respectively.  \n\nMr. Parashuram emphasizes the urgent need for a focused approach to address this issue, as the current system lacks specific programs for boys who have been sexually exploited.  He highlights the psychological trauma these incidents inflict, potentially leading to further delinquency and a \"runaway syndrome\" where victims flee their homes or institutions. \n\nHe calls for a comprehensive study to understand the backgrounds of these victims, including their social status and caste, to develop effective rehabilitation strategies. The lack of attention and resources dedicated to this issue underscores the need for immediate action from both the state and central governments."

This move signifies the franchise's commitment to the explosive batsman who played a pivotal role in their run to the IPL 2024 finals.\n\nWhile Klaasen takes the top spot, captain Pat Cummins will be retained as the second player, albeit at a slightly reduced price of Rs 18 crore.  Despite leading SRH to the finals and being the second most expensive player in IPL history, Cummins' retention value will be lower than Klaasen's. \n\nThe franchise is also likely to retain young Indian batsman Abhishek Sharma for Rs 14 crore, recognizing his impressive debut season with a staggering strike rate of 204. The retention of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who recently made his T20I debut for India, is also confirmed. \n\nThe decision to prioritize Klaasen over Travis Head, who scored the most runs for SRH last season, is surprising. However, Head's retention is still expected, though the exact figure remains unknown. The deadline for player retention is set for October 31st."

They accused Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of stalling the implementation of internal reservation, despite the Congress party including it in its 2023 election manifesto and despite the Chief Minister publicly stating his support for the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nThe protesters also expressed disappointment in the Congress leadership, including AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge, accusing them of betraying the Madiga community. The Okkuta has set a deadline of October 30 for the government to act, and they are calling for a statewide \"Jail Bharo Andolan\" if their demands are not met. They have also dropped plans for a mock funeral procession of the Chief Minister, after police issued warnings to Okkuta leaders."

This surge in demand is driven by a projected 4% annual growth, fueled by factors like rising incomes, increased appliance ownership, and the adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nThe IEA's World Energy Outlook report highlights that daily electricity demand variability in India, currently averaging 15%, is expected to nearly triple by 2050. This shift will be largely attributed to the increasing use of air conditioning as incomes rise and the growing popularity of appliances and EVs.\n\nDespite the growth, India's electricity demand will remain behind China and the United States in 2050. While the IEA forecasts a significant increase in electricity consumption, it also acknowledges the continued importance of coal in India's energy mix. The report suggests that nearly 60 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity will be added by 2030, leading to a 15% rise in electricity generation from coal. Coal currently meets 40% of India's industrial energy needs, and this figure is projected to increase by 50% by 2035."

Alam Pasha, founder of an NGO, argues that the 2023 notification authorizing the Auqaf Board to register marriages contradicts the provisions of the Wakf Act, 1995.  The petitioner claims that the Act does not empower Wakf Boards to register marriages.\n\nThe petition further points out that while marriages based on personal laws are valid in India, the Karnataka Marriages (Registration and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1976 mandates the registration of all marriages in the state. This responsibility is vested in sub-registrars of Stamps and Registration, not the Auqaf Board.\n\nThe High Court will now hear the case and determine whether the state government's authorization of the Auqaf Board to issue marriage certificates is legally valid."

This achievement marks a major success for the institution's renal transplant program, which has been providing hope to patients across the region since 1989.\n\nThe Urology department at NIMS attributes the accelerated pace of transplants to the introduction of the Jeevandan cadaver transplant program in 2015. This program, combined with the expertise of the urology team, has allowed for the successful completion of over 100 kidney transplants annually for the past ten years. The team has also performed a significant number of pediatric transplants, demonstrating their commitment to addressing the needs of all patients.\n\nNIMS's integrated approach to urological care is another key factor in its success. Unlike many hospitals that maintain separate units for transplant and general urological surgeries, NIMS operates with a unified team. This allows for efficient and effective handling of complex transplants alongside routine urological procedures, ensuring a seamless and comprehensive patient experience.\n\nThe department has expressed gratitude for the continued support from the Telangana government, particularly Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, Minister for Health C. Damodar Raja Narasimha, and NIMS Director Dr. N. Bheerappa. This milestone serves as a testament to the dedication and expertise of the urology team at NIMS, who have consistently strived to provide life-saving care to patients in need."

        "news": "Salt production in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu has come to an end due to the onset of the northeast monsoon, ending the season on a disappointing note. This year, salt production fell short of expectations, with only around 13 lakh tonnes produced out of a potential 25 lakh tonnes. \n\nThis shortfall can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\n* **December 2023 Deluge:** Devastating floods in December 2023 caused significant damage to salt pans, requiring extensive repair work before production could resume.\n* **Delayed Start:**  The damage from the floods led to a delayed start of the production season, further impacting overall output.\n* **Unseasonal Rains:** Unseasonal rains continued to affect production until May, further hindering the process.\n\nThese challenges resulted in a loss of around six lakh tonnes of salt stock due to rain in December. The closure of the salt pans for the next three months will leave approximately 20,000 workers unemployed until production resumes in January."

        "news": "As Diwali approaches, many Indians are considering gold investments. Jewellers offer monthly deposit schemes, similar to SIPs, where you contribute a fixed amount each month for a set period to purchase gold. This method allows for systematic accumulation of physical gold, often with discounts or store credit from jewellery brands like Tanishq.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand the tax implications. If you hold the gold for more than two years, it is considered long-term capital gains (LTCG) taxed at 12.5%. However, the indexation benefit is no longer available.  If sold within two years, it's short-term capital gains (STCG) taxed at your income slab rate. \n\nDiscounts or benefits offered by these schemes may also have tax implications depending on their nature. While there is no direct income tax on receiving the gold at maturity, you will be subject to capital gains tax if you later sell it.\n\nExperts advise due diligence before investing. Check the jeweller's credibility, financial standing, and transparency regarding gold purity and manufacturing fees. Assess the scheme's flexibility for payments and premature withdrawal. Be aware of any undisclosed expenses."

Bajaj Auto's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) reached an all-time high of Rs 2,653 crore, reflecting a 24% YoY growth with a margin exceeding 20%.\n\nThe company's board also approved an additional investment of up to $10 million in its wholly-owned subsidiary Bajaj Brazil. \n\nWhile the results showcase Bajaj Auto's positive performance, it's important to note that the profit growth was adjusted for a deferred tax liability of Rs 211.26 crore due to changes in the taxation of debt mutual funds."

This trend is projected to continue, with GCCs expecting to increase fresher hiring by 40% year-on-year. \n\nThe IT services sector as a whole is anticipating a 20-25% growth in fresher recruitment, reflecting the strong demand for skilled professionals.

This growth is attributed to the strategic importance of expertise in data engineering, product management, and DevOps, with salaries seeing a rise of 6.54% to 10.8%.\n\nDespite the strong demand, the report highlights a critical skills gap.  Only 37% of tech employees upskilled last year, with 73% citing a lack of time and 42% citing lack of managerial support as barriers.  To address this, the report emphasizes the importance of companies investing in upskilling programs to ensure their workforce can adapt to the rapid changes in technology, particularly in AI and cloud computing."

He believes the selection of Mamkootathil, a relatively young and inexperienced politician, could lead to a loss for the Congress in the bypoll. \n\nSarin's dissatisfaction appears to stem from a perceived influence of former Lok Sabha MP Shafi Parambil, who vacated the Palakkad seat to contest from the Vadakara constituency. He alleges that Parambil's involvement in bringing Mamkootathil to the forefront is detrimental to the party's interests. \n\nSarin has written to Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, advocating for a reconsideration of the candidate selection. He believes the party should prioritize selecting a candidate with a strong local presence and proven track record to ensure victory in Palakkad. \n\nMamkootathil, the Youth Congress State President, has chosen not to directly respond to Sarin's allegations, only stating that their personal relationship remains unaffected. \n\nThe bypoll in Palakkad is scheduled for November 13th, and the Congress faces an uphill battle in the face of this internal discord.  The outcome of this bypoll could significantly impact the party's standing in Kerala."

Rama Rao (KTR), working president of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), has continued his criticism of the Congress government in Telangana over their Musi riverfront development project. He accused the government of prioritizing flashy schemes over addressing real concerns and targeting the poor. \n\nKTR specifically questioned the lack of a detailed project report (DPR) for the \u20b91.5 lakh crore project and claimed that the government's focus on beautification is overshadowing important water management issues. He also expressed concerns about the impact of the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) initiative, alleging it is being used to intimidate residents and builders. \n\nKTR defended the BRS government's previous efforts to beautify the Musi river, stating that they did so without harming the poor. He further criticized the Congress government's environmental policies, questioning the justification for cutting down 12 lakh trees in the name of beautification while ignoring concerns elsewhere.\n\nKTR has pledged to visit areas affected by the government's actions, including sewage treatment plants built by the previous BRS government, and provide support to affected residents, including legal assistance."

Jefferies argues this projection fails to account for potential risks, including:\n\n* **Higher impact on overall market volumes:** The recent SEBI F&O regulations, while aiming to tighten the index derivatives market, could lead to a greater reduction in overall market volume than anticipated. \n* **Limited spillover gains:** The spillover of trades from discontinued weekly products to the remaining weekly contracts might be less significant than expected.\n* **Further regulations:** There's a possibility of additional regulatory measures that could further impact BSE's market share and growth prospects.\n\nDespite raising its target price for BSE to Rs 3,500 (from Rs 2,850), Jefferies believes the stock still faces a 23.6% potential downside. The brokerage also acknowledges that BSE has seen positive growth in the first half of FY25 across segments, but the current valuation appears to be discounting potential risks. \n\nInvestors are advised to exercise caution and consider the potential downside risks before making investment decisions."

Starting with a modest loan of \u20b91.5 crore from their father in 2004, Theobroma has grown from a single outlet in Mumbai to over 225 across India, now valued at a whopping \u20b93,500 crore. \n\nTheobroma's success is a testament to the sisters' passion and determination. Kenaz, a trained pastry chef, had to quit her job due to a back injury, leading to the birth of Theobroma.  Their initial focus was on offering premium, European-style baked goods, targeting a younger, discerning clientele in Mumbai. Theobroma's unique approach, coupled with its unwavering commitment to quality, helped it carve a niche in India's nascent bakery market.\n\nNow, Theobroma is poised for its biggest chapter yet. The brand is reportedly in talks for a potential acquisition by ChrysCapital, which could result in one of the largest cash exits for founders in India's business history.  If the deal goes through, it would mark a significant milestone for the Messman sisters and their journey from a small loan to a multi-billion rupee enterprise."

Additionally, Naik is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for suspected terror activities. \n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, stated that Naik's lawyer had indicated a potential withdrawal of the petition. However, Naik's lawyer denied receiving such instructions and asserted that the plea seeks the merging of around 43 cases filed across different states.\n\nThe Supreme Court has directed Naik's counsel to submit an affidavit clarifying whether the petition will be pursued or withdrawn. The Centre has been instructed to file a response to the petition. The case is scheduled for further hearing on October 23.\n\nNaik, who was born in Mumbai, fled India after the 2016 Dhaka cafe bombing, where one of the attackers reportedly cited inspiration from Naik's speeches. He is accused of promoting hatred among communities through his Peace TV channel and social media platforms, which boast over 20 million followers.

Sharing food habits reveals a potential match's adventurousness, health consciousness, and even their political and social views.  For instance, vegetarianism in India is often tied to caste and political beliefs.  \n\n**Data Supports the Trend:**\n\n* **Tinder:**  Popular food-related interests among Indian users include Maggi, sushi, biryani, street food, vegan cooking, baking, and Korean food. 94% of Indian singles surveyed agree that food and restaurant preferences are important in dating. \n* **Bumble:**  73% of Indian singles believe bonding over food is crucial. 68% prioritize food choices when making dating decisions and prefer adventurous food options on first dates. \n\n**Food-Focused Dating Experiences:**\n\nPopular dating apps, like Happn, feature \"CrushPoints\" that connect users who frequent the same locations.  In most Indian cities, restaurants and bars top the list of most visited locations. This reflects the popularity of restaurant hopping as a dating activity. \n\n**Not Everyone is Convinced:**\n\nWhile food preferences are gaining traction, not all singles prioritize them. Some are more interested in shared interests and personalities.

From shared culinary adventures to understanding deeper societal and political connections, food is proving to be a surprisingly potent ingredient in the dating game."

        "news": "Hyundai Motor Company, the South Korean parent of India's second largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, is set to rake in massive profits from the company's initial public offering (IPO). The IPO, valued at a whopping Rs 27,856 crore, marks India's largest IPO to date.\n\nHyundai Motor Company is offloading a 17.5% stake in its Indian subsidiary, leaving room for a further 7.5% sale in the next three years.  This sale is part of the company's strategy to meet the minimum public shareholder requirements set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for listed Indian companies.\n\nThe parent company's investment in Hyundai Motor India, made over two decades ago, is poised to deliver remarkable returns. The IPO's price band of Rs 1,865-1,960 per share indicates a profit margin of 196 times, or 19,500 percent, for Hyundai Motor Company.\n\nThe IPO has received a positive reception from brokerages, who cite the company's strong financial track record, brand recognition, expansion plans, market share, and premiumization strategy as attractive factors. However, concerns remain regarding the IPO's aggressive pricing, depleting cash reserves, large size, potential for future stake sales, and the fact that it is an offer-for-sale (OFS) rather than a fresh issue. \n\nThe grey market premium (GMP), a measure of the unofficial market value of an IPO, has seen a recovery after an initial decline. Currently, the GMP is estimated at Rs 60-65, suggesting a listing pop of only 3 percent for investors. \n\nThe IPO's allotment process follows standard procedures, with shares allocated to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), retail investors, and non-institutional investors in a predetermined ratio.  The success of the IPO hinges on achieving a minimum 90 percent subscription rate."

They argue that this approach would provide a level playing field for existing telecom operators. \n\nHowever, the government\u2019s stance aligns with the global trend of administrative allocation and will potentially accelerate Starlink's entry into the rapidly growing Indian mobile and internet market.\n\nWhile the decision has been applauded by Starlink, it remains to be seen how this will impact the existing telecom landscape and the future of satellite-based communications in India."

        "news": "Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar attended the 23rd Meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government in Islamabad on October 16, 2024. In his address, he criticized \"unilateral\" connectivity projects in the region, implicitly referring to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nJaishankar emphasized the need for cooperation based on \"mutual respect, sovereign equality, territorial integrity and genuine partnerships.\" He also stressed the importance of addressing cross-border terrorism, extremism, and separatism, which he claimed hinder trade, travel, and people-to-people relations. \n\nJaishankar's visit marks the first time an Indian Foreign Minister has attended the SCO Summit in Pakistan in nine years. His presence, along with other leaders like Russian and Chinese Prime Ministers, reflects the growing importance of the SCO as a platform for regional cooperation.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, Jaishankar clarified that his visit is solely to participate in the SCO Summit and not for bilateral talks with Pakistan. This comes after a heated exchange between Jaishankar and the Pakistani Foreign Minister at the SCO Foreign Minister's meeting in May 2023."
