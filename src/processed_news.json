        "news": "India's Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has ordered ride-hailing platform Ola to give consumers a choice between a bank account refund or a coupon for refunds. Previously, Ola only offered coupons for refunds, which the CCPA deemed a violation of consumer rights. \n\nThe CCPA's directive stems from a surge in complaints against Ola, with over 2,000 complaints registered between January and October 2024. \n\nThe authority also ordered Ola to:\n\n* **Provide invoices for all rides:**  This ensures transparency and accountability for services.\n* **Clearly display cancellation policy and fees:**  This allows consumers to make informed decisions about cancelling rides.\n* **Show driver the pickup and drop-off locations:**  This minimizes confusion and inconvenience.\n* **List fare components:**  Consumers can see the breakdown of their fare, including base fare, distance charges, and waiting time.\n* **Encourage drivers to accept digital payments and use AC:** This improves service quality for riders.\n* **Shorten payment cycles for drivers:** This benefits drivers by ensuring quicker payments.\n\nThe CCPA's actions reflect its commitment to protecting consumer rights and ensuring fair practices within the e-commerce industry."
