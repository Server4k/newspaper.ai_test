This makes it ideal for rehydration, especially after exercise or during hot weather. It also supports heart health, aids digestion, and can assist with weight loss and blood sugar regulation.\n\n**Coconut milk**, on the other hand, is rich in healthy fats, particularly medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). These fats provide quick energy and support metabolism. Coconut milk also boosts immunity, promotes healthy skin and hair, and serves as a dairy-free alternative for those with dietary restrictions.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n* **Coconut water** is best for hydration, low-calorie diets, and post-workout recovery. \n* **Coconut milk** is best for those needing healthy fats, energy, or a dairy-free option.\n\nUltimately, both coconut water and coconut milk can be beneficial additions to a balanced diet.

Stay Hydrated:** Prioritize hydration throughout the day. Break your fast by slowly sipping water, avoiding gulping.\n\n**2. Limit Caffeine:** Avoid caffeine before fasting, as it can increase thirst. After breaking the fast, opt for water and electrolyte-rich drinks instead of coffee. Herbal teas and vegetable soups are also healthy alternatives.\n\n**3. Balanced Pre-Fast Meal:** Include nutritious foods alongside traditional delicacies before sunrise.  Focus on fiber-rich foods to promote satiety and slow digestion, preventing blood sugar spikes.  Limit sugary foods and beverages.\n\n**4. Prioritize Rest:** Avoid strenuous physical activity and exposure to sunlight, as they can increase energy expenditure, leading to hunger and thirst. Prioritize rest and sleep instead.\n\n**5. Light Post-Fast Meals:**  Break your fast with light foods like nuts, seeds, fruits, or soup, allowing your digestive system to gradually adjust after a day of fasting. Avoid heavy, processed foods.\n\n**Important Note:**  Long fasts like Ahoi Ashtami can affect blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and hormonal health. Consult with your doctor if you have any health concerns."

This allows AI agents to perform actions like moving a mouse, clicking, and typing, effectively taking over manual keystrokes.  \n\nThis feature is particularly relevant for software developers, marking a significant step towards the development of sophisticated AI agents capable of multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention.  While traditional chatbots primarily generate text or code, these AI agents can handle more complex operations autonomously.  \n\nAnthropic showcased the feature's capabilities, demonstrating its ability to code a basic website and plan an outing using tools like Google Search and Apple Maps.\n\nThis new functionality is currently available for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the latest version of Anthropic's mid-tier model, and Haiku 3.5, the entry-level model. Notably, Haiku 3.5 now generates computer code comparable to Sonnet, a significant performance boost. Anthropic also hints at an update for its most advanced model, Opus, by year's end.\n\nWhile this feature comes with safeguards to prevent misuse, Anthropic acknowledges potential for errors.  This advancement follows Microsoft's recent announcement of a tool allowing clients to build custom AI agents for tasks such as query resolution and inventory management."

He specifically questioned the government's claim of restoring the status quo ante, asking whether Indian troops will be able to patrol to their pre-2020 positions, including access to critical locations like Depsang and Demchok. \n\nThe Congress leader also raised concerns about the continued presence of \"buffer zones\" ceded to China, which included the site of a memorial to war hero Major Shaitan Singh. \n\nFurthermore, Ramesh pointed out the lack of parliamentary debate on the agreement, highlighting what he perceives as a \u201cpusillanimous stance\u201d by the government. He also criticized India's growing economic dependency on China, citing the increase in Chinese exports to India while Indian exports remain stagnant. \n\nThe Congress\u2019s statement comes ahead of the bilateral talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS summit in Russia.  The party's demand for transparency and explanation on the agreement with China remains a key point of contention, highlighting the ongoing political scrutiny surrounding the issue."

Apple's \"Apple Intelligence\" goes beyond flashy chatbots, offering smarter notifications and intuitive device personalization, all while prioritising privacy.\n\nRather than relying heavily on cloud-based AI, Apple is developing AI that runs directly on user devices, ensuring data remains private. This \"private cloud compute\" system aims to encrypt and protect user data, addressing concerns about potential misuse of data by tech giants.\n\nFederighi highlights the challenges and importance of this approach, acknowledging the desire to \"get it right\" before releasing features. This cautious approach, while frustrating for some users eager for immediate breakthroughs, reflects Apple's commitment to responsible AI development.\n\nThe first batch of Apple Intelligence features will be released with iOS 18.1, but many of the flagship tools shown at Apple's June event are still in development. Federighi emphasizes that Apple is \"trying to get each piece right and release it when it\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nApple's privacy-first approach, while challenging, is core to its brand and sets it apart from companies like OpenAI who process data through cloud servers. Apple's AI aims to function directly on the user's device whenever possible, using cloud processing only when absolutely necessary.\n\nWhile this cautious approach may be perceived as a delay by some, Federighi clarifies that it's a strategic decision to ensure a successful and responsible long-term integration of AI into Apple's ecosystem. This journey, he emphasizes, will take years, even decades, but the focus on privacy and gradual, well-executed development promises a more responsible and user-centric future for AI."

The new stretch, extending from Nagasandra to Madavara, adds three stations: Manjunathnagar, Chikkabidarakallu, and Madavara.  \n\nThe extension, approved by the Commissioner for Metro Railway Safety (CMRS), promises shorter travel times and improved connectivity to the city center.  Residents along Tumakuru Road, known for its heavy traffic, are eagerly anticipating the launch.\n\nThe new line will not only benefit commuters but also enhance accessibility to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC). \n\nFuture plans for Namma Metro include extending the line from BIEC to Tumakuru, a 70 kilometer journey, and potentially from Kempegowda International Airport to Devanahalli. These projects are part of the government's wider plan to improve public transportation using Public-Private Partnership models."

The video, originally shared in 2009, resurfaced online following Tata's passing in October 2024. \n\nThe video captures the launch of the Tata Nano, a revolutionary concept car aimed at making personal mobility accessible to the Indian middle class.  The video shows Tata, alongside other officials, handing over the keys to the proud new owners of the car. The host explains that the company was delivering the first 100,000 units to those who had pre-ordered the model. \n\nThe Tata Nano, launched in 2008 with a starting price of just Rs 100,000, was dubbed the \"world's most affordable car\".  Despite initial excitement, the Nano faced sales challenges and production halted in 2020 due to declining demand and stringent emission regulations. \n\nThis viral video serves as a reminder of Ratan Tata's visionary leadership and his commitment to developing affordable and accessible products for the Indian market."

        "news": "The festival of Diwali is often accompanied by a surge in gold investment in India.  While buying physical gold remains a tradition, gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and gold mutual funds have gained popularity. Examining their performance over the past year, physical gold emerges as the champion in absolute returns.\n\n**Physical Gold:**\n\n* **Recent Performance:** 39.7% gain in the last year. This outpaces benchmark indices like the BSE Sensex (25.1%) and NSE Nifty50 (27.9%).\n* **Long-Term Trends:** Gold prices have risen significantly in recent years.  A three-year period saw a 68.9% return, while a five-year period showed a remarkable 108.9% increase. \n\n**Gold ETFs:**\n\n* **Current Market:**  17 Gold ETF schemes currently available, offering an average one-year return of 29.12%.  \n* **Top Performers:**  Nippon India ETF Gold BeES, HDFC Gold ETF, and SBI Gold ETF lead the market in terms of assets managed. \n* **Long-Term:** While the average return for gold ETFs over three years is 16.93% and five years is 13.59%, LIC MF Gold ETF stands out with a consistently high return across all time frames. \n\n**Gold Mutual Funds:**\n\n* **Mechanism:** These funds invest in other mutual fund schemes, particularly gold ETFs.\n* **Top Performers:**  Axis Gold Direct Plan-Growth, Aditya Birla Sun Life Gold Fund, SBI Gold Direct Plan-Growth, Quantum Gold Savings Fund, and HDFC Gold Fund have shown significant returns in the past year. \n\n**The Verdict:**\n\nPhysical gold outshines gold ETFs and mutual funds in terms of absolute returns. However, the choice between these options depends on individual investment goals and risk appetite. While physical gold offers tangible ownership, ETFs and mutual funds provide convenience and liquidity. \n\n**Nikhil Behl, CEO of INDmoney, emphasizes the ease of buying and selling, liquidity, and flexibility offered by both ETFs and mutual funds. He also highlights the lower expense ratios of gold ETFs compared to gold mutual funds, potentially leading to greater cost-effectiveness.**"

Disney+ Hotstar\u2019s superior technology infrastructure, larger user base, and higher paid subscriber count were key factors in the decision.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar boasted 333 million monthly active users and 35.5 million paid subscribers by Q4 2023, compared to JioCinema's 225 million users and 16 million paid subscribers. This larger user base and stronger financial foundation give Disney+ Hotstar a significant advantage.\n\nThe merger, which saw Reliance acquire a controlling 56% stake in the combined entity, with Disney holding 37% and Bodhi Tree Systems owning 7%, received approval from relevant authorities earlier this year. \n\nThis consolidation means that the upcoming IPL 2025 season will likely stream on Disney+ Hotstar, marking a shift from the previous two years when JioCinema held the rights.\n\nStar India is expected to manage the operations of the merged entity, integrating Viacom18's TV and streaming assets under its banner.

While HDFC Bank stands out for its relatively strong asset quality, the sector faces a tightening credit cycle and rising non-performing assets (NPAs). \n\n**However, the non-lending segment of the financial sector has shown resilience.** AMCs and brokerages have benefited from increased financial inclusion and a growing appetite for capital markets.  Haria highlights companies like JM Financial, which are pivoting away from lending and towards fee-based investment banking.\n\n**The insurance sector, particularly health insurance, faces its own challenges.**  While the government's recent move to exempt health insurance products with coverage up to Rs 5 lakh from GST is seen as a positive gesture, it's not expected to be a game-changer for the sector. Haria argues that deeper reforms are needed to address the sector's slow growth and low penetration, particularly in the non-affluent segments.\n\n**In terms of specific recommendations, Haria favors Muthoot Finance** as the sole pick in the lending financial space due to its exposure to gold loans, which are viewed as relatively insulated from broader economic challenges. \n\n**Regarding the NBFC sector, Haria acknowledges the risks posed by their high dependence on bank funding** and the potential for regulatory headwinds. He anticipates a challenging December quarter for the unsecured lending space, including microfinance and personal loans, as the worst of the pain cycle comes to fruition.\n\n**Haria remains cautiously optimistic about the long-term outlook for AMCs and brokerages, but advises investors to be selective.**  He emphasizes the need for continued vigilance in the lending space, particularly in the unsecured segments, and highlights the potential for growth in secured lending, including gold loans, commercial vehicle loans, and housing finance."

        "news": "The Supreme Court of India has overturned a \u20b9158 crore (approximately $19 million USD) settlement agreement between embattled ed-tech firm Byju's and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The court found that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had deviated significantly from proper procedure in allowing the settlement. \n\nChief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud stated that the NCLAT's decision was flawed because it allowed Byju's promoter to personally settle the debt with the BCCI, potentially leaving other creditors without due compensation. This ruling highlights the continued financial challenges faced by Byju's, which has been grappling with mounting debt and investor concerns. \n\nThe court has now directed that the \u20b9158 crore be deposited into an escrow account controlled by the Committee of Creditors (CoC), ensuring that all creditors receive a fair share of the funds. This decision marks a significant setback for Byju's and could further complicate its efforts to recover from its financial difficulties."

Within 24 hours of its launch, the system blocked over 13.5 million calls, representing 90% of all identified spoofed calls.\n\nSpoofed calls, which falsely display Indian phone numbers while originating from abroad, have been used to defraud citizens through impersonation, financial scams, and fear-mongering tactics. The new system, developed by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in collaboration with telecom service providers, is designed to detect and block these calls before they reach Indian users.\n\nThe government, led by Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, hails this initiative as a crucial step towards a safer digital space for Indian citizens. While the system is expected to significantly reduce the number of spoofed calls, users are advised to report suspicious communications through the Sanchar Saathi platform."

This unprecedented statement comes amidst speculation that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking support from Turkey's pro-Kurdish political party in Parliament to enact a new constitution, potentially allowing him to stay in power indefinitely.\n\nBahceli's statement has sparked considerable interest given the long-standing conflict between the Turkish government and the PKK. The PKK has been fighting for an autonomous state in southeastern Turkey since 1984, leading to tens of thousands of casualties. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.\n\nOcalan, the PKK's leader, has been serving a life sentence on a prison island off Istanbul since 1999. He is currently held in isolation, according to the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (HDP), the third largest party in Parliament. The HDP has consistently advocated for improved conditions for Ocalan.\n\nBahceli's proposal for parole hinges on Ocalan's public renunciation of violence and the dissolution of the PKK. He suggests that Ocalan could be allowed to speak at a HDP meeting in the Turkish Grand National Assembly, a significant gesture indicating potential rehabilitation. While this proposition remains speculative, it raises the possibility of a significant shift in Turkish politics."

The court ruled that the term \"intoxicating liquor\" in the Constitution's State List includes industrial alcohol, giving States the power to regulate its production, manufacture, and sale. \n\nThe decision stems from a long-standing dispute between the Centre and several states, including Kerala, Maharashtra, and Punjab, over control of industrial alcohol and the potential for its misuse in the production of intoxicating liquor. \n\nThe Centre argued that industrial alcohol falls under its jurisdiction as an industry regulated by the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951, citing the Union List's provision for industries deemed to be in public interest. \n\nHowever, the court found that the State's power to regulate intoxicating liquor under the State List is paramount and extends to industrial alcohol, emphasizing the States' responsibility for public health and safety.\n\nThe majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, stated that the phrase \"intoxicating liquor\" should be interpreted broadly to encompass all alcoholic liquids that could pose a threat to public health, including industrial alcohol.\n\nThe court also highlighted the potential for misuse of industrial alcohol for illicit liquor production, noting the States' concern for liquor-related tragedies and their need to prevent such incidents.\n\nJustice B.V. Nagarathna was the sole dissenting judge, arguing that industrial alcohol does not fall under the definition of \"intoxicating liquor\" and that States do not have the legislative power to regulate it."

He argues that Georgia, like Ukraine, was denied NATO membership and is being used as a pawn by Western powers seeking to provoke Russia.\n\nWhile most Georgians favor closer ties with the West, Ivanishvili's message resonates with those wary of repeating the 2008 war with Russia over the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Opinion polls suggest his party is on track to win the elections, although its support may decline.\n\nIvanishvili's critics portray him as a power-hungry oligarch who controls the government and is aligned with Moscow. They accuse him of undermining democratic institutions and turning Georgia into a \"private company.\"\n\nDespite Ivanishvili's anti-Western rhetoric, his party claims it remains committed to integration with the West while pursuing a pragmatic policy toward Russia. \n\nThe Georgian Dream government's recent actions, including anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and laws targeting foreign-funded organizations, have drawn criticism from the West and led to the suspension of some aid and the freezing of Georgia's EU membership application. \n\nThis election will be crucial for determining Georgia's future direction, with its relationship with Russia and the West hanging in the balance."

This represents a significant increase in early voting, driven by both mail-in ballots and in-person voting at designated polling stations. \n\nWhile the overall election outcome remains uncertain, political pundits predict the election will hinge on the results from seven key battleground states: Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. \n\nEarly voting is a unique feature of the US election process, allowing voters to cast their ballots before Election Day. This year, both Democrats and Republicans are utilizing early voting strategies, with Republicans showing a particularly strong turnout. \n\nWhile the Democrats have traditionally relied on early voting, Republicans are now actively promoting it, potentially shifting the voter landscape in their favor. \n\nThe early voting figures offer valuable insights into the potential election outcome, but the final results will depend on the turnout on Election Day."

This feat, achieved during a Ford Trophy match against the Otago Volts at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, shattered the previous record held by Australian batsman Travis Head (114 balls).\n\nBowes' incredible innings included 27 fours and seven sixes before he was dismissed for 205 by Matt Bacon.  This performance also makes him the second player in history to score a double century in the Ford Trophy, after Jamie How (222 in 2012-13).\n\nInterestingly, Bowes' journey to this record-breaking performance was influenced by Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming, who helped him join the Sydenham cricket club in Christchurch. \n\nBowes' blistering knock ultimately contributed to Canterbury's total of 343/9."

While components for the tri-fold model are reportedly complete, Samsung Electronics\u2019 MX division still needs to finalize the launch decision. \n\nThe news comes amidst a challenging market for foldable phones. Sales have fallen short of expectations, with demand for Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 failing to meet projections. This has led to a decrease in production for OLED displays used in foldable devices. \n\nDespite the setbacks, Samsung's entry into the tri-fold market could shake up consumer expectations. The potential to expand a phone into a tablet-like device may attract users seeking a more flexible mobile experience. However, with Huawei already leading the way, Samsung will need to offer something truly innovative to stand out in the increasingly competitive market."

The textbook states that the Ganga originates from Gomukh, which is only partially true. While the Bhagirathi River originates from Gomukh, the Ganga is actually formed at Devprayag, where the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers converge.\n\nEducational experts argue that 7th graders are in their formative years and require accurate and comprehensive information. They fear that this incomplete knowledge about the Ganga, a culturally and religiously significant river, could have a negative impact on their future understanding. \n\nThe textbook's inaccuracies include:\n\n* **Incorrect Origin:** The textbook claims the Ganga originates from Gomukh, failing to mention the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda.\n* **Missing Information:** It does not mention the total length of the Ganga, its trajectory across different states, or its spiritual importance.\n* **Omission of Ganga's Name in Bangladesh:** It does not explain that the Ganga is known as the Padma in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Angla Bhasha Shiksha Sansthan (English Language Education Institute) in Prayagraj, responsible for textbook evaluation, has assured that the inaccuracies will be rectified. The institute is currently reviewing the textbook and plans to implement the revised version in the next academic year. Additionally, the curriculum is being standardized with the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) guidelines.\n\nThe incident highlights the need for thorough review and accurate information in textbooks, especially when it comes to topics with cultural and historical significance."

An analysis by BloombergNEF reveals that the country is projected to meet only 10% of its 2030 green hydrogen production target based on current progress. \n\nDespite awarding contracts for 1.1 metric tonnes equivalent of green hydrogen production capacity (over a fifth of the 2030 goal),  most investment proposals haven't reached the crucial stage of signing binding offtake contracts. The lack of green hydrogen consumption mandates in industries further hinders progress, leading BNEF to predict a mere 0.5 Mt/year production capacity by 2030.\n\nAlthough the government has auctioned 3 gigawatts of annual electrolyser manufacturing capacity, the absence of sector-specific end-use in most federal tenders allows developers flexibility in both selling and exporting the fuel.\n\nOn the cost front, current green hydrogen production costs in India hover around $3-5 per kilogram, potentially reduced by 70 cents through federal subsidies. Uttar Pradesh offers the most generous incentives, potentially bringing the cost down to $2/kg, making it competitive with grey hydrogen ($1.9-2.4/kg) used in refineries.\n\nHowever, the majority of offtake agreements (binding or unbinding) rely on exporting the clean fuel to advanced economies like Europe and Japan.  This export-focused strategy aims to achieve economies of scale and lower production costs, while the domestic market matures."

        "news": "Sonam Kapoor's fashion label, Bhaane, has purchased Mumbai's legendary music store, Rhythm House, for \u20b947.8 crore ($5.7 million). The store, once owned by fugitive jeweler Nirav Modi, closed in 2018 after Modi's company, Firestar Diamond International, defaulted on bank loans. \n\nRhythm House, a 3,600-square-foot landmark in Mumbai's Kala Ghoda district, was a cultural hub for decades, hosting renowned musicians and Bollywood stars. Its decline began in the late 1990s due to music piracy and the rise of digital streaming. \n\nWhile Bhaane confirmed the purchase, they declined to discuss financial details. The company plans to expand its retail presence in Mumbai, adding to its existing portfolio of Nike and Converse stores. \n\nThe sale marks the end of an era for generations of music lovers who frequented the store for vinyl, cassettes, and CDs.  The future of the iconic space, however, remains uncertain."

        "news": "Flooded underpasses in Bengaluru continue to pose a serious threat to public safety, highlighting the city's lack of preparedness for monsoon season. The issue came to the forefront in May 2023 when a 23-year-old tech professional tragically lost her life after the car she was in was submerged in a flooded underpass near K.R. Circle. Despite this incident, numerous underpasses across the city, including those at Okalipuram, Panathur railway, and Madiwala Ayyappa Temple, have repeatedly flooded during recent heavy rainfall. \n\nWhile the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has taken some measures like closing underpasses during intense rainfall, experts criticize their lack of progress in addressing the root causes of flooding. Design flaws, particularly in U-shaped underpasses, where water accumulates quickly at the lowest point, are blamed for the recurring issue.  These structures lack proper drainage systems and the steep approach ramps contribute to rapid water accumulation.\n\nThe BBMP's attempts to mitigate the issue, including desilting drains, installing humps, and removing mud, have proved insufficient.  The city needs a comprehensive approach, focusing on  remedial actions like covering U-shaped underpasses with galvanized sheets to prevent water accumulation. \n\nExperts emphasize the importance of addressing the design flaws in underpasses and the need for robust drainage systems.  Until these issues are resolved, Bengaluru's flooded underpasses will remain a dangerous and avoidable hazard."

Overflowing lakes, including Doddabommasandra Lake, exacerbated the situation. Water levels in some areas reached six feet, causing power outages.\n\nResidents of Kendriya Vihar, where water levels reached up to six feet, were evacuated using 16 boats, with 10 more being deployed for faster evacuation. The BBMP provided temporary accommodation at a community hall, although many residents opted for alternative arrangements.\n\nThe evacuation was expected to last for eight days, allowing residents to clean the apartment complex and return."

He emphasizes that Punjab is a major agricultural contributor to India, producing around 12 tons of rice per hectare, a global record.\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann echoed these concerns, urging Union Home Minister Amit Shah to intervene and ensure smooth procurement. Mann expressed concerns about transportation costs, storage shortages, and the quality of hybrid varieties impacting the process. \n\nWhile the state government has made arrangements for smooth procurement, the delayed lifting process is causing delays, with concerns raised about storage space availability."
