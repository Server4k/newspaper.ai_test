        "news": "The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has ordered ride-hailing platform Ola to allow customers to choose their preferred refund method: a bank transfer or a coupon for future rides. This follows a surge in complaints about Ola's previous practice of only offering coupon codes for refunds, which the CCPA deemed a violation of consumer rights. \n\nThe CCPA also directed Ola to:\n\n* **Provide invoices for all rides:** This aims to enhance transparency and accountability.\n* **Clearly display cancellation policies and fees:** Customers must be aware of potential cancellation costs before booking.\n* **Improve communication with drivers:** Encouraging digital payments and air conditioning use, along with faster payment cycles.\n\nThis action reflects the CCPA's commitment to ensuring a fair and secure experience for consumers on e-commerce platforms. It follows a rise in consumer complaints against Ola, with over 2,000 grievances lodged between January and October 2024."
