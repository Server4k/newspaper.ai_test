        "news": "ITC's Q2 results showed a mixed bag for the Indian conglomerate, with strong revenue growth but pressure on margins. Revenue increased by 16.8% year-on-year, surpassing analyst expectations due to strong performance in the agri business. Cigarette volumes grew in line with projections, driven by portfolio and market initiatives.\n\nHowever, FMCG \"Others\" Ebitda fell due to inflationary pressures and weak performance in the notebooks business, struggling against local competitors and lower paper prices. The paper segment also saw muted growth due to cheap Chinese imports. \n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about ITC's long-term prospects, citing its strong competitive position and size. Antique Stock Broking maintained a \"Buy\" recommendation with a target price of Rs 557, while Emkay Global maintained an \"Add\" rating with a target price of Rs 520, acknowledging near-term margin challenges. Other analysts, including Citi, Nomura, and Morgan Stanley, also hold positive views on ITC. \n\nDespite the mixed results, ITC's Q2 performance showcased its resilience in a challenging market. The company's diversified portfolio and strong brand portfolio position it for continued growth, but it will need to address margin pressures effectively to achieve its full potential."

AI systems analyze mammograms, flagging non-suspicious cases, allowing radiologists to focus on potentially problematic images.  LeCun also highlighted Meta's FastMRI project, which utilizes AI to significantly reduce the time needed for MRI scans, leading to earlier detection of tumors and improved patient outcomes. \n\nLeCun emphasizes that AI is not replacing doctors, but rather serving as a powerful tool to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.  The transformative power of AI, he asserts, is already saving lives and improving the quality of life for millions worldwide."

This departure follows a series of exits from OpenAI's safety team, including researcher Jan Leike and co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who both raised concerns about the company's prioritization of products over safety.\n\nBrundage's concerns echo a broader debate within the AI community about the ethical implications of AGI. While some researchers remain committed to advancing AI for societal benefit, others are increasingly critical of the rapid commercialization of the technology and its potential for unintended consequences. \n\nBrundage plans to pursue independent research on AI governance, hoping to foster open dialogue on the topic without corporate influence as the field moves closer to AGI."

Held during the Dasara festivities, the festival culminates in the \u201cBanni Jaitra Yatra\u201d procession, where villagers wielding sticks and carrying torches escort the deities of Mala Malleswara Swamy and his consort through the village.  This procession, though deeply ingrained in tradition, has also been marked by violence and bloodshed, with injuries and even fatalities occurring in recent years.\n\nThe stick-fighting, known as \u201cKarrala Samaram\u201d, is believed to be a symbolic reenactment of Lord Shiva\u2019s victory over demons. Some devotees believe participating in the fight brings good luck, attributing any injuries received as blessings from the deity. However, the actual practice has become increasingly violent, with villagers often clashing with each other, injuring devotees in the process.\n\nDespite the widespread evidence of violence, no police cases have been filed, and locals deny the existence of any organized fight for control of the deities. The festival's priest maintains that the violence is an exaggeration, claiming that the stick fighting is simply a part of the procession and not an intentional act of aggression.\n\nThis year, despite the continued presence of the controversial stick-fighting, there were no reported deaths. This is attributed to the efforts of the police and district administration, who deployed drones and CCTV surveillance to monitor the festival and intervened to minimize violence.  Despite these efforts, many participants still sustained injuries, demonstrating the need for a change in the ritual's execution.\n\nEfforts to educate villagers and encourage the use of safer alternatives, such as plastic sticks, have not yielded substantial results. The police remain hopeful that with time and ongoing efforts, the festival will become more peaceful, allowing devotees to celebrate their faith without the risk of injury or death."

This decision comes after a meeting with his Liberal MPs, where over 20 lawmakers expressed their desire for a leadership change. \n\nTrudeau's decision has sparked controversy, as he faces mounting pressure due to recent electoral losses and public dissatisfaction with his handling of key issues such as the rising cost of living. The Liberals recently lost special elections in two Toronto and Montreal districts, raising concerns about his leadership and potentially impacting their chances in the upcoming election.\n\nWhile Trudeau has received support from the majority of his Cabinet Ministers, some MPs remain unconvinced. Sean Casey, one of the MPs who signed the letter calling for Trudeau's resignation, expressed disappointment but accepted the decision, focusing his efforts on winning his own seat.\n\nThe upcoming election is scheduled between this fall and next October, with the Liberals requiring the support of at least one other major party to form a government. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the Conservative Party, and the New Democratic Party are all poised to challenge the Liberal Party's hold on power.\n\nDespite facing criticism, Trudeau remains confident in his leadership. He has emphasized that he will continue to lead the party into the next election, citing his ability to address key concerns and build a better future for Canada. The coming months will prove crucial in determining whether Trudeau's gamble will pay off and see him return as Prime Minister."

        "news": "The long-awaited Cauvery V Stage project, bringing piped water to 110 villages surrounding Bengaluru, has finally been commissioned.  This project, costing \u20b94,600 crore, promises to alleviate the water woes of these rapidly urbanized areas, which have been reliant on expensive tankers and borewells.\n\nThe BWSSB aims to provide connections to at least 4 lakh households, increasing their revenue to \u20b9140 crore per month. However, the project is facing teething problems:\n\n* **Distribution Network:** While the main pipelines are laid, distribution channels are not yet complete in some areas, leading to delays in connections.\n* **High Costs:** Apartment communities are complaining about high connection fees, with some estimating costs exceeding \u20b91 lakh per flat.  The BWSSB's current system charges the entire apartment as one connection, making it financially prohibitive for many.\n* **Overreliance on Cauvery:** The project, coupled with the planned Cauvery VI Stage, will increase Bengaluru's water consumption to 35 tmcft annually, exceeding the allocated 23 tmcft for the city. This raises concerns from farmers who argue that Bengaluru's water needs are prioritized over agricultural needs.\n\nThese concerns highlight the need for sustainable water management strategies in Bengaluru. While the Cauvery V Stage project offers immediate relief, it reinforces the city's dependence on a single water source. Experts call for:\n\n* **Judicious Water Use:**  Incentivizing water conservation measures and implementing dual pricing models to make water usage more equitable.\n* **Alternative Sources:**  Prioritizing rainwater harvesting, watershed management, and treated wastewater for non-potable uses.\n\nThe success of the Cauvery V Stage project will ultimately depend on addressing these concerns and moving towards a more sustainable water future for Bengaluru."

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued severe weather warnings, stating that the landfall process would continue until Friday morning.\n\nThe coastal districts of Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Balasore, and Jagatsinghpur experienced wind speeds reaching 100-110 kmph, accompanied by intense rainfall. While reports of uprooted trees were received, no major damage or casualties have been reported so far.\n\nThe IMD forecasts wind speeds to reach 120 kmph at the storm's center and a tidal surge of up to two meters above the astronomical height in the affected districts. The landfall process is expected to last for about four to five hours.\n\nDespite the storm's intensity, the Odisha government had proactively evacuated around 5.84 lakh people from high-risk areas in coastal districts.  The IMD further predicts that the storm will gradually weaken on Friday as it moves further inland, bringing heavy rainfall to most of Odisha. \n\nThe IMD has issued warnings for gale-force winds and heavy rainfall, urging residents to remain vigilant and follow safety guidelines."

The court deemed the NGO a third party with no direct or indirect stake in the demolitions.\n\nA three-judge bench led by Justice B.R. Gavai emphasized that those directly affected by the demolitions should approach the court. \"We do not want to open a Pandora\u2019s box by entertaining this at the instance of a third party,\" Justice Gavai said.\n\nThe court had previously issued a stay order in September against such demolitions, recognizing them as a form of \"bulldozer justice\" and emphasizing that authorities cannot bulldoze the law. While the court acknowledged the stay order's applicability to the current case, it maintained its position that only those directly impacted by the demolitions have standing to bring the case before the court.\n\nThe NFIW argued that the stay order should apply to the demolitions in question, and that many affected individuals were unable to access legal recourse due to imprisonment or displacement. Justice Gavai refuted this, suggesting that family members or even concerned neighbors could act on behalf of those affected.\n\nThe court's decision highlights its commitment to ensuring a fair and impartial legal process in addressing these demolitions. While acknowledging the concerns raised by the NFIW, the court has maintained its position that those directly impacted by the actions must be the ones to seek legal redress."

The ruling JMM-led coalition and the Opposition BJP are vying for their support, showering promises of financial assistance. This strategy has been effective in other states, with parties like the BJP employing similar tactics in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.\n\nThe JMM government's Mukhyamantri Maiya Samman Yojana (MMSY) provides \u20b91,000 per month to women aged 18-50. The BJP, in response, has launched its Gogo Didi Yojana, offering \u20b92,100 per month. The JMM has since increased the MMSY payment to \u20b92,500, further escalating the competition for women's votes. \n\nWhile both parties use this financial assistance as a key campaign tool, women in Jharkhand appear less concerned with the political maneuvering and more focused on the direct benefits.  Many beneficiaries, like Sukhiya Tirkey and Neelam Lakra, value the financial assistance for its contribution to their families' well-being and independence.  The competition between the parties has resulted in increased financial assistance for women, ultimately benefiting those receiving it. \n\nThis strategy, however, has been met with criticism from the BJP, who accuse the JMM of using these schemes as a political ploy. The BJP emphasizes its commitment to its Gogo Didi Yojana, promising its implementation should they come to power.  \n\nDespite the political sparring, women in Jharkhand are clear about their priorities: tangible financial benefits that directly improve their lives. The upcoming election will determine which party's promises resonate most with this influential voting bloc."

He secured conditional bail two days later. However, the police filed a petition on Monday alleging he had violated bail conditions, leading to the cancellation of his bail and subsequent re-arrest.\n\nThe main accusation against the producer is his attempt to seize 80 acres of land in Rayadurg and 10 acres in Yacharam, both located on the outskirts of Hyderabad. \n\nThe police initially invoked sections related to cheating and forgery, but curiously omitted Section 467 (forgery) from the charges, despite the alleged crime revolving around forged documents. The police have explained that Section 468, which covers forgery for the purpose of cheating, was invoked instead. \n\nLegal experts have suggested that the accused remain in prison until the trial concludes, given the substantial value of the land involved.\n\nA coincidental transfer of the magistrate who granted bail to the film producer added another layer of intrigue to the ongoing case."

Biodegradable waste must be treated onsite through composting or bio-methanation, while recyclable waste should be handed over to GCC-authorized garbage collectors. \n\nThe GCC has implemented 300 point-of-sale (POS) machines across 15 zones to collect fines. Between October 10th and 24th, a total of \u20b925,73,800 was collected, with Zone 5 recording the highest number of transactions. \n\nGCC Commissioner J.

        "news": "Despite a Kerala High Court order mandating closed doors on all moving buses, numerous private bus operators in Kozhikode district continue to ignore the rule. This disregard for passenger safety stems from the widespread malfunctioning of pneumatic doors, often due to a lack of regular maintenance.\n\nWhile some buses have installed pneumatic doors, many are inoperable, creating hazards during boarding and alighting. Drivers also struggle with these faulty systems, particularly during peak traffic hours, when passengers often resort to standing on the footboard. \n\nA retired Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) officer attributes the issue to operators' reluctance to invest in regular servicing of the doors. The officer also points out that passengers are dissatisfied with the unprofessional and unsafe operation of the doors.\n\nRecent accidents involving passengers being thrown from buses without doors during sudden stops or high-speed travel have failed to trigger significant changes in the operation of these buses. The elderly and students are particularly vulnerable to this negligence. Additionally, incidents of passengers getting pinched by malfunctioning doors have led some operators to simply run buses with open doors.\n\nThe decline in bus revenue has also contributed to the problem, making it less appealing for operators to employ door attendants full-time. This, coupled with the frequent unavailability of the passenger-operated door option on many buses, further escalates safety concerns.\n\nIn response to the rising complaints, MVD officers and road safety squads are increasing their efforts. Flash inspections on both city and rural routes are being conducted to crack down on \"open-door trips\" and other safety violations. A week-long special checking drive involving various enforcement squads is also being considered."

Chief Minister Hemant Soren is contesting from Barhait, his wife Kalpana from Gandey, and brother Basant from Dumka. \n\nThe election campaign has seen heated rhetoric with Hemant Soren labeling BJP leaders from other states as \"migratory people\" who will \"vanish\" after the elections. He believes these leaders are merely campaigning in Jharkhand for political gain and will leave after the results are announced. \n\nThe BJP has retaliated with strong criticism, comparing the ruling coalition of JMM, Congress, and RJD to a \"cyclone.\" Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, in charge of the BJP campaign in Jharkhand, asserted that the coalition is more dangerous than Cyclone Dana. \n\nFurthermore, the financial wealth of the Soren family is coming under scrutiny. According to the affidavit, Kalpana Soren is richer than Hemant Soren, with her assets significantly increasing over the past five years. \n\nWith the first phase of polling scheduled for November 13th and the second phase on November 20th, the Jharkhand Assembly elections are expected to be closely contested.  The focus will be on the Soren family's ability to retain power against the BJP's challenge."

The rally, organized by right-wing groups including the Sanyukt Sanatan Dharma Rakshak Dal, Bajrang Dal, and Devbhoomi Raksha Abhiyan, alleged that the mosque was illegally built on government land near the Kashi Vishwanath temple.\n\nThe protesters, who had obtained permission for the rally, attempted to break through police barricades, leading to a confrontation. Police responded with a lathi-charge to disperse the crowd after stones were thrown at them. \n\nDarshan Bharti, head of the Devbhoomi Raksha Abhiyan, claimed that the mosque was initially a small room that had expanded over time and alleged the land was illegally acquired from a Hindu family. However, Uttarkashi District Magistrate Meharban Singh Bisht had previously confirmed that the mosque possesses all necessary documents and is registered with the Waqf Board."

However, official records reveal that Saxena was informed about the \"blunder of felling the trees\" on April 12th.\n\nThis inconsistency led the Supreme Court to direct both the L-G and former DDA Vice-Chairperson Subhasish Panda, who was in office during the tree felling incident, to file affidavits explaining the discrepancy. They are also required to disclose the date on which they first obtained knowledge of the tree felling.\n\nThe court has requested the original records related to the incident to be submitted for review. The case has been adjourned until Tuesday. \n\nThis investigation stems from a petition filed in the Supreme Court alleging that the trees were felled on Saxena's orders after a site visit on February 3rd. The L-G has denied any involvement in the illegal felling, stating he visited the site on his way back from the Central Armed Police Forces Institute of Medical Sciences (CAPFIMS) Hospital and was not informed that felling the trees required Supreme Court permission."

The court is expected to deliver its verdict on Friday.\n\nLanga's legal team highlighted a discrepancy in the police's seizure memo, which does not list the journalist's phone among the recovered items.  Vedanta Rajguru, Langa's counsel, pointed out that the memo mentions two laptops, a desktop, an iPhone, a pen drive, tax returns, documents, \u20b91.8 lakh, a phone directory, and a book manuscript, but not the phone. The police also claimed to have recovered \u20b920 lakh from Langa's home, which is also not mentioned in the memo.\n\nWhile the police did not respond to these points in court, they indicated that the \u20b920 lakh was recorded orally during a \"panchnama,\" a police procedure for recording an incident.\n\nThe police have also filed a separate case against Langa, based on a complaint by the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), accusing him of theft, criminal conspiracy, cheating, and corruption. The GMB alleges that Langa leaked confidential documents, in connivance with GMB staff.  The police are investigating whether these documents were part of the items seized by the Ahmedabad Crime Branch, but they are not mentioned in the seizure memo.\n\nLanga's arrest stems from a GST scam investigation involving Dhruvi Enterprise, a company accused of creating fake firms to claim fraudulent tax credits.  Manoj Langa, a relative of Mahesh Langa, owns DA Enterprise, which is mentioned in the FIR.  The arrest of Mahesh Langa is based on Manoj's statement. \n\nThe case continues to unfold, with the court's decision on Langa's bail application expected on Friday."

This led to a noticeable reduction in employment opportunities.\n\nThe report highlights a sharp decline in specific districts such as Nellore (35.1% decrease), Kurnool (30.9% decrease), and Tirupati (22.4% decrease). However, some districts, including Parvathipuram Manyam, Sri Sathya Sai, and Alluri Sitharama Raju, bucked the trend by showing an increase in person-days.\n\nA caste-wise analysis revealed disparities in employment opportunities. Scheduled Castes and \"Others\" experienced significant declines, while Scheduled Tribes saw a slight improvement. This suggests that targeted interventions may have been effective for certain groups. \n\nTo address the declining trend and ensure the long-term sustainability of MGNREGA in Andhra Pradesh, the report recommends closer collaboration between the state and central governments. This partnership would help address compliance issues and provide support to struggling districts, ultimately revitalizing employment opportunities and securing the program's success."

        "news": "Delhi's air quality continues to be a serious concern, with AQI levels consistently hovering in the \"very poor\" category.  While we're aware of the immediate impacts on our lungs and respiratory systems, a growing body of research reveals a more insidious danger: the long-term effects of air pollution on brain health.\n\nProlonged exposure to pollutants like lead, mercury, and volatile organic compounds can bypass the blood-brain barrier, leading to inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage. This, in turn, can impair cognitive functions like memory, attention, and executive functioning, as well as increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  Higher levels of PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide have also been linked to an increased risk of these debilitating conditions.\n\nBeyond cognitive decline, air pollution is also associated with reduced brain volume, accelerated brain aging, and even mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Children are particularly vulnerable, as exposure to high levels of pollution can hinder their cognitive development.  Elderly individuals also face heightened risks of cognitive decline due to pollution.\n\nWhile immediate effects of pollution on the eyes and skin are more apparent (redness, itching, breakouts, etc.), the long-term consequences are equally concerning.  Airborne pollutants can trigger asthma attacks, contribute to chronic respiratory diseases, and even lead to skin damage and premature aging.\n\nExperts urge individuals to take preventative measures such as using air purifiers to create a safe indoor environment, wearing masks when outdoors during high pollution levels, and adopting healthy lifestyle habits.  This collective effort is crucial to mitigating the silent and long-lasting effects of air pollution on our brains and overall health."

The post, a simple \"Let's go brother\" in Hindi, has been interpreted by some as a cryptic message amid swirling divorce rumors surrounding the couple. \n\nThe rumors began after Aishwarya Rai and their daughter Aaradhya were absent from family events, including the Ambani wedding, where the rest of the Bachchan family was present.  Further fueling speculation, Abhishek \"liked\" a post discussing divorce, and the couple has not been seen together in public since.\n\nWhile the Bachchan family has remained silent on the matter, Aishwarya Rai's recent solo appearance at the SIIMA Awards, where she won the Best Actress (Critics) Award, only intensified the rumors.  Aishwarya and Abhishek have been married for 17 years and have a daughter, Aaradhya, together. \n\nThe recent online activity has sparked widespread discussion, though no official statement has been made by the couple or their families."

Notably, all nine seats will be contested by candidates from the backward, Dalit, and minority communities. This strategy, dubbed \"PDA\" ( \u092a\u093f\u091b\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0926\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0905\u0932\u094d\u092a\u0938\u0902\u0916\u094d\u092f\u0915) aims to consolidate support among these voter groups. \n\nThe SP fielded four Muslim, two Dalit, and three backward caste candidates, with no representation from the general category. This strategy follows a similar approach adopted for the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat, highlighting the party's focus on consolidating these voter groups.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav, the SP president, has used the slogan \"\u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u0906\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u0938\u094c\u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u092c\u091a\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092c\u093e\u092a\u0942-\u092c\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u092c-\u0932\u094b\u0939\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0939\u0948\" (Saving the Constitution, Reservation, and Harmony; building the country envisioned by Gandhi, Ambedkar, and Lohia). This slogan emphasizes the party's commitment to social justice and unity while aligning with the aspirations of backward and minority communities.\n\nThis strategy aims to exploit the current political climate, emphasizing social justice and inclusivity. The SP's decision to field candidates solely from these communities aims to secure their votes and build a strong base for the upcoming elections."

        "news": "The former Chairman of the 7th State Finance Commission, K.N. Harilal, has advocated for increasing the share of states in the divisible pool of taxes. He argues that while the central government receives 63% of total revenue, it only bears 37% of the expenditure.  \n\nHarilal, speaking at a seminar on cooperative federalism, highlighted the discrepancy in revenue sharing between the central and state governments. He criticized the 15th Finance Commission's recommendation of 41% of the divisible pool for states, as the central government has been increasing its revenues through cesses and surcharges, which are not shared with states. \n\nHe also pointed out the significant increase in central government revenue through disinvestment and dividends from the Reserve Bank of India, further emphasizing the need for a larger share of the divisible pool for states.\n\nThe Public Policy Research Institute (PPRI), which organized the seminar, urged the 16th Finance Commission to implement a more scientific and inclusive criteria for its recommendations. \n\nThis call for a fairer share of the divisible pool for states highlights the need for a more balanced approach to federalism in India."

However, the Oswal family vehemently denies these claims, stating that Menaria is alive and living in Tanzania.\n\nMenaria, a resident of Rajasthan, worked for the Oswal family in various capacities since 2017, including cabin crew on their private jet and domestic help at various residences. \n\nFollowing a breakdown in their relationship earlier this year, Menaria left the Oswal family and is reportedly living in Tanzania. The Oswals claim that Menaria was apprehended in Tanzania and has signed an affidavit stating he was never kidnapped or tortured by the family and is in Uganda of his own accord. \n\nWhile the details surrounding Menaria's affidavit remain unclear, the Oswal family maintains that he is a willing participant in the alleged conspiracy against Vasundhara, orchestrated by business rivals and corrupt Ugandan officials.\n\nThe incident has sparked controversy, with the Oswal family alleging that Vasundhara's detention is politically motivated and a result of false accusations. \n\nThe true circumstances surrounding Menaria's disappearance and Vasundhara's arrest remain unclear, but this case highlights the complexities of power, business, and alleged corruption in international affairs."
