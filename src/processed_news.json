        "news": "In a historic deal, Google has committed to purchasing power from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to fuel its ever-growing AI infrastructure. This marks the first corporate agreement of its kind, with Google partnering with Kairos Power to bring the first reactor online by 2030, followed by additional reactors by 2035.  \n\nGoogle aims to procure a total of 500 megawatts of power from six to seven SMRs, which are smaller and potentially more cost-effective than traditional nuclear plants.  The move reflects the surging energy demands of tech giants as AI technology rapidly expands.\n\nWhile financial details and reactor locations remain undisclosed, Google believes nuclear power offers a clean, reliable solution for its round-the-clock AI needs.  Other tech companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, are similarly exploring nuclear power to meet their growing energy demands.\n\nKairos Power's SMR technology utilizes a molten salt cooling system and ceramic pebble fuel to transfer heat to a steam turbine for power generation. The company is currently testing its technology through hardware demonstrations before building its first commercial reactor. This approach is designed to improve cost certainty and speed up deployments.\n\nGoogle's commitment to an \"order book framework\" for SMRs signals a long-term investment in the technology.  This unique approach could significantly impact the development and adoption of SMRs, offering a potential alternative to traditional energy sources as the demand for clean energy continues to rise."

        "news": "Reliance Jio, led by Akash Ambani, has announced a strong performance for the second quarter of the fiscal year, reporting a 23.1% increase in standalone net profit to Rs 6,231 crore. Revenue from operations of Jio Platforms, which includes Reliance Industries\u2019 telecom and digital businesses, climbed 18% to Rs 31,709 crore in the September quarter.\n\nThis growth is attributed to a rise in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) to Rs 195.1, driven by a partial implementation of tariff hikes and a shift towards a higher-value subscriber base. \n\nAkash Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm, highlighted the company's focus on deep tech innovation and its commitment to creating the world's best AI ecosystem in India. This strategic move is fueled by Jio's belief that AI will play a crucial role in driving future digital transformation.\n\nWhile Jio's total subscriber base slightly declined to 478.8 million in Q2 FY25, the company attributes this to SIM consolidation, which is expected to taper off in the future. Notably, Jio boasts 148 million 5G subscribers, solidifying its position as the largest 5G operator outside China.\n\nJio's future performance hinges on the full impact of the tariff hikes, which is projected to be realized over the next 2-3 quarters."

A unique feeder bus service, operating within the layout itself, has seen nearly 5,000 passengers utilize it daily, a remarkable feat for a system that has only been operational for a year. \n\nThis success story, spearheaded by the HSR Citizen Forum and the HSR Cyclists group, highlights the potential of localized, well-planned, and efficient feeder systems.  The service operates on a closed loop route, covering all seven HSR Layout sectors with 10-minute intervals.  This network has proven effective, despite initial challenges with the use of large buses on roads with tight turning radius.\n\nThe HSR project's success was not a sudden occurrence. Years of research, data analysis, and extensive citizen engagement were crucial for its implementation.  This involved understanding the specific needs of the community, including travel patterns, pain points, and demands for various demographics. \n\nThis model could be replicated across Bengaluru, but it requires a similar dedicated approach.  Local communities can actively participate in designing routes, choosing bus types, and conducting trial runs.  The HSR project has demonstrated the impact of reliable, predictable schedules, a stark contrast to the inadequate public transport options faced by many Bengalureans. \n\nThe project's success is expected to be further amplified once the Airport Metro line is operational, but experts argue that the system will need further adaptation, such as using smaller buses to manage congestion.  The city's existing BMTC depots could be strategically utilized to create more localized services, effectively restructuring the city's public transport network. \n\nBy learning from the HSR Layout model, Bengaluru can potentially achieve a more efficient and inclusive public transport system, offering a viable alternative to private vehicles and improving the overall quality of life for residents."

        "news": "India's muted reaction to the ongoing violence in Gaza has sparked criticism, with many questioning why a country historically known for its anti-colonial stance and support for Palestinian rights appears to be turning a blind eye.\n\nWhile Israel's brutal response to Hamas attacks has garnered global condemnation, India has remained largely silent. This silence has been attributed to several factors, including:\n\n* **Growing ties with Israel:** India's strategic alliance with Israel, deepened by defense and intelligence cooperation, has influenced its stance. \n* **Shifting geopolitical landscape:**  India's focus on its own regional security, particularly in relation to China, and its pursuit of closer ties with the US, Israel's primary ally, have taken precedence over Palestinian issues.\n* **Influence of Hindutva ideology:** The rise of Hindu nationalism within India has led to a perception of the Palestinian cause as a \"Muslim issue,\" further discouraging support for it.\n\nThe silence, however, is not absolute. Some individual opposition leaders have spoken out in support of Palestine, and left-wing parties have organized protests. However, the lack of a strong and unified response from the government and broader civil society raises concerns about the erosion of anti-imperialism and India's commitment to human rights.\n\nThe article highlights the complex geopolitical and ideological forces shaping India's response to the Gaza crisis, emphasizing the need for a more critical examination of India's stance and a return to its historical principles of solidarity with oppressed nations."

This move comes after several EC members voiced strong opposition to the proposal, viewing it as an infringement on DU's autonomy.\n\nThe proposal, which originated from the Union Ministry of Education in August, argues that a Ministry representative is essential for \"aligning the governance structures of all Central universities\" and fostering closer collaboration. The Ministry also demands that university statutes be amended to include the representative within 60 days.\n\nThe committee, tasked with examining the proposal's implications, includes former University Grants Commission member Inder Mohan Kapahy, Proctor Rajni Abbi, Director of South Campus Shri Prakash Singh, and Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani.\n\nCritics of the proposal, including elected EC members Aman Kumar and Seema Das, argue that the inclusion of a Ministry representative would significantly increase government influence over university decisions. Das, in a statement, called the proposal a \"direct attack\" on DU's autonomy, noting that it would impact even the nature of discussions within the university. \n\nThe proposal has sparked concern as Central universities already include nominees of the President and Vice-President of India. The inclusion of a Ministry representative raises questions about the extent of government control over university affairs and the potential for undermining academic freedom."

The assurance comes amid concerns raised by the opposition Congress, who accused both the state and central government of delays in procurement.\n\nThe Centre stated that procurement began on October 1 and is progressing as planned. They are aiming to procure 124 lakh tonnes of rice from Punjab, equivalent to 185 lakh tonnes of paddy, without any restrictions. Over 2,200 local markets are operational in Punjab for paddy procurement, with approximately 6 lakh tonnes already procured out of a total arrival of 7 lakh tonnes.\n\nAddressing concerns regarding storage space, the Union government said adequate arrangements are in place to avoid any disruptions. They have prepared a plan to provide 40 lakh tonnes of storage by December 2024, through the liquidation of wheat and rice stocks from existing godowns in Punjab. \n\nHowever, CM Mann raised concerns regarding insufficient storage space, particularly in light of the previous season's shortage. He requested the Centre to facilitate the movement of at least 20 lakh metric tonnes of food grains per month from Punjab until March 31, 2025, using various schemes like Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) and ethanol allocation. \n\nThe Congress party, on the other hand, warned of an impending agrarian crisis due to insufficient storage for the estimated 185 lakh metric tonnes of paddy expected to arrive by the end of the procurement season.

        "news": "Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) is set to debut on the stock market tomorrow, October 15th, with its Initial Public Offering (IPO).  The company, the second largest passenger car manufacturer in India, has already secured a strong foundation for its public listing by raising a significant Rs 8,315 crore from 225 anchor investors. \n\nThis anchor investment, at the upper end of the price range (Rs 1,960 per share), signals confidence in HMIL's prospects. Notable investors include GIC (Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund), New World Fund, Fidelity, and several prominent domestic mutual funds.\n\nThe IPO aims to raise a total valuation of Rs 1.51 lakh crore to Rs 1.59 lakh crore, representing a 26.3 times multiple of its FY24 earnings. This valuation is slightly lower than market leader Maruti Suzuki India. \n\nHMIL is offering 50% of the public issue to qualified institutional buyers, 15% to non-institutional investors, and 35% to retail investors. The minimum investment for retail investors is Rs 13,720, with a maximum investment limit of Rs 2 lakh.\n\nThis IPO is significant for the Indian equity market, as it gauges the appetite for investments in the auto sector. Hyundai\u2019s strong market share (nearly 15%), diverse product portfolio, and commitment to EV development in India make it an attractive proposition. \n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

He alleges that the raids are a result of his refusal to switch parties. \n\nThe ED searched 20 locations in Ranchi and Chaibasa, including premises belonging to IAS officer Manish Ranjan, Thakur's personal secretary, brother, and a businessman.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had previously accused the Jharkhand government of corruption, alleging misuse of funds meant for the poor. Thakur refuted these claims, stating that the ED should reveal any illegal documents or seized assets found during the raids. \n\nChief Minister Hemant Soren dismissed the raids as a predictable tactic by the BJP ahead of elections, calling the ED \u201cactive workers\" of the opposition party. The JMM, Soren's party, accused the BJP of misusing constitutional institutions and resorting to political tactics rather than open competition."

The incident occurred at around 2pm near Thadagam, where the chimney belonging to the RSK Chamber Bricks unit crumbled onto the busy road.\n\nThe brick kiln had been closed since 2021 following a Madras High Court directive shutting down all brick kilns in the Thadagam valley. Despite its inactivity, the chimney was not properly maintained, leading to its deterioration. Heavy rainfall on Sunday exacerbated its condition, ultimately causing its collapse. \n\nThe incident also damaged a transformer and powerlines associated with the chamber. Traffic along the main road was disrupted for approximately 30 minutes while scattered bricks were removed using an earthmover. Normal traffic flow resumed after the debris was cleared."

The KERC plans to incentivize the use of RATs with higher electricity tariffs compared to solar-only installations. \n\nThe draft regulations require a minimum installation capacity of 1 kilowatt for RATs and stipulate that the combined capacity of RATs and solar panels should not exceed 1.25 times the consumer's sanctioned load. Consumers have 180 days to commission their RAT systems after signing a power purchase agreement with the electricity distributor.\n\nThe KERC is accepting feedback on the draft regulations for 30 days before finalizing them.  The move is expected to encourage greater adoption of renewable energy sources and reduce dependence on fossil fuels."

In contrast, Haryana has already seen more stubble burning incidents this year than in 2020 and 2021. \n\nUttar Pradesh, too, is experiencing an increase in stubble burning this year, reaching its highest level in five years. The Supreme Court recently criticized the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for failing to control stubble burning, despite its commitment to preventing the practice. \n\nThe rise in stubble burning is already impacting Delhi's air quality, which has been categorized as \"poor\".

While both Punjab and Haryana have committed to managing a significant portion of their paddy straw through various methods, a lack of implementation and economic incentives for farmers continue to contribute to the ongoing practice."

However, RIL's Digital Services segment saw increased average revenue per user (ARPU) and improved customer engagement metrics, driven by the success of JioAirFiber. Ambani also expressed confidence in the company's New Energy business, with the first Giga-factory expected to begin solar PV module production by year-end.\n\nThe retail sector continues to expand its product offerings and partnerships, aiming for rapid growth in the coming quarters. Reliance is also focused on delivering the benefits of artificial intelligence to all Indians through its digital services business."

The petition, filed by the NGO Sindhi Sangat, argued that such a channel would uphold the linguistic rights of the Sindhi community as outlined in Article 29 of the Constitution. \n\nHowever, the court, led by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, ruled that establishing a dedicated channel is not the only means to preserve linguistic rights.  The court emphasized that Article 29 does not guarantee an absolute right to a separate channel for any specific language.\n\nThe NGO had argued that Section 12(2)(d) of the Prasar Bharati Act mandates \"adequate coverage\" of diverse languages and cultures, making a dedicated Sindhi channel a necessary step. The Delhi High Court had previously dismissed the petition in May 2024, finding it misplaced and noting that Prasar Bharati's decision against a Sindhi channel was based on valid reasons."

A report by the Munnar Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) reveals the presence of 387 unauthorized shops scattered across the forest division, attracting elephants and other animals. These shops, particularly the 71 located along the Munnar-Bodimettu National Highway, are contributing to the issue by generating waste that attracts wildlife.\n\nThe report highlights the irresponsible dumping of chemical and salt-laden waste by shops and tourists, which further incentivizes elephants to venture into the town. The lack of proper waste management, exemplified by the dysfunctional Kallar waste treatment plant, is exacerbating the situation. Elephants are attracted to the facility, consuming plastic waste and finding ample food sources, making them reluctant to return to their natural habitat.\n\nThis situation has already led to human-animal encounters, including a recent attack on Haritha Karma Sena members by a wild tusker named Ottakompan. The report also points out that many of these unauthorized shops are operated by organized groups, rather than local residents. \n\nThe Forest department's Rapid Response Team is struggling to manage the escalating human-animal conflict, highlighting the urgent need for action. The report suggests either removing all unauthorized shops within the Munnar forest division or implementing daily waste removal from these establishments.\n\nLocal businesses have also expressed concern, highlighting the impact on tourism and the safety of residents. An expert panel appointed by the Kerala High Court to address human-animal conflicts in Chinnakkanal has recommended the immediate removal of unauthorized roadside shops and the installation of solar-powered steel wire fences around the Kallar dump yard."

He also alleges that the Belagavi district administration has failed to protect the temples, resulting in damage to the structures and idols.\n\nThe petitioner cites the example of the Venugopala Swamy temple, which was relocated from the backwaters of the KRS dam in Mysuru district in 2011 with financial assistance from an industrial house. He suggests that the Allama Prabhu Swamy and Vitthal temples could be relocated similarly. \n\nThe court has ordered the State government and ASI to respond to the petition.

The company's total subscriber base for Jio Platforms rose by 4.2% year-on-year to 47.9 crore, with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 195.1. \n\nThe company remains optimistic about its diversified business portfolio, highlighting the resilience of its operations amidst challenging market conditions."

This comes after the court granted conditional bail to two other accused, Ravishankar and Deepak, bringing the total number of accused on bail to five.\n\nThe prosecution argued against Darshan's bail, citing strong evidence, including technical and eyewitness accounts. They highlighted the discovery of bloodstains matching the deceased on Darshan's footwear. The court also noted DNA evidence linking Darshan to the crime scene and the brutal nature of Renukaswamy's murder, emphasizing the risk of him influencing the case if released. \n\nThe defence countered by claiming Darshan's lack of involvement and absence at the time of the murder. However, the court deemed these arguments insufficient, highlighting the delay in investigations as no justification for disregarding witness statements.\n\nDespite the decision, Darshan's legal team plans to appeal the ruling in the High Court, citing health reasons. Renukaswamy's family has welcomed the court's decision and called for a swift trial.\n\nThe case involves the alleged kidnapping and murder of Renukaswamy in June 2024. The accused allegedly tortured him in a shed before disposing of his body in a storm drain."

The \"Nature Interpretation Centre,\" a collaborative project between WWF-India and HSBC, showcases the rich history of Kokrebellur and its unique relationship with the avian visitors.  \n\nThe centre, a treasure trove of information, reveals how the village, once situated on the banks of River Shimsha, relocated in 1916 after a plague outbreak. Remarkably, the birds followed, choosing to live near humans despite the absence of a water body. This symbiotic relationship has flourished over the years, with the village being declared a community reserve in 2007 - the only one in Karnataka. \n\nHowever, the village, like many others, faces the consequences of environmental degradation.  Wetland areas have shrunk, and agricultural land has doubled, threatening the birds' habitat.  Factors like tree felling, sand mining, and water pollution have resulted in a decline in bird populations. \n\nDespite these challenges, the villagers of Kokrebellur remain committed to coexisting with the birds. They actively protect them and their nests, even utilizing their droppings to produce organic manure. \n\nConservation efforts, including tree planting, sustainable agriculture practices, and electrical cable insulation to prevent bird electrocution, are underway. Local communities have also established a rehabilitation centre for injured birds, showcasing their dedication to ensuring the well-being of these feathered visitors.  \n\nKokrebellur stands as a testament to the power of human-wildlife harmony, highlighting the importance of sustainable practices and community involvement in preserving biodiversity."

Transport.\n\nDuring the clearing process, a leopard reportedly escaped from the thicket, highlighting the significance of this initiative. The removal of invasive weeds like *Lantana camara* and *Senna spectabilis* is expected to promote the growth of indigenous flora and discourage wildlife from seeking refuge near human settlements. \n\nWith over 200 acres of exotic and invasive vegetation surrounding Moyar, further clearing operations are anticipated to further reduce human-wildlife conflict in the region."

        "news": "India has issued a strong warning to Canada, reserving the right to take further steps following accusations against Indian diplomats in the killing of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) rejected Canada's allegations, calling them \"concocted,\" and summoned the Canadian Charge d\u2019Affaires. \n\nThe situation has escalated following Canada's naming of Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma and other diplomats as \"persons of interest\" in the Nijjar killing. In response, India has already decided to recall Mr. Verma and five other diplomats, a move former diplomats described as necessary given the potential threat to their safety. \n\nFormer High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria labelled Canada's actions a \"needless escalation\" of an already strained relationship, calling for an apology and retraction of the accusations.\n\nIndia is considering a range of further measures, including:\n\n* **Downgrading diplomatic ties:** This could involve reducing the size of the Indian High Commission in Ottawa and demanding a similar move from Canada. \n* **Economic sanctions:** India could impose tariffs on Canadian goods, scrutinize Canadian investments, and ban certain companies and apps, mirroring actions taken against China in 2020.\n* **Visa restrictions:** India could suspend or restrict visas for Canadians, causing significant hardship for the diaspora, particularly those needing to return to India for family matters.\n* **Flight suspensions:** Direct flights between the two countries could be cancelled, similar to the action taken against China during the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe current situation marks a significant deterioration in India-Canada relations, with both sides expelling diplomats and creating a hostile environment for diplomatic missions. The potential for further escalation remains high, and the outcome will have significant implications for the bilateral relationship."

        "news": "India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 5.49% in September, marking a nine-month high. This increase was driven primarily by soaring food prices, which jumped to 9.24% in the same period. The inflation figure surpasses the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target of 4%. \n\nThe food inflation, which accounts for roughly half of the CPI basket, saw a significant jump from 5.66% in August. This rise is attributed to a steep increase in vegetable prices, which recorded a 48.73% inflation rate in September. \n\nThe wholesale price inflation (WPI) also rose to 1.84% in September, further indicating rising prices. This increase is largely attributed to the rising cost of food items, particularly vegetables.\n\nThe CPI for August had reached a five-year low of 3.65%."

His net worth, estimated at Rs 7,900 crore (approximately $980 million), has sparked speculation about who will inherit his fortune.\n\nTata's wealth largely stemmed from his 0.83% stake in Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group. Additionally, he made numerous investments through his private investment vehicle, RNT Associates, in companies like Ola, Paytm, and Urban Company.\n\nOne potential heir is Noel Tata, Ratan Tata's half-brother. Noel has been increasingly involved in Tata Trusts following Ratan's passing, serving as a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. His growing role suggests he may eventually gain control of these organizations.\n\nWhile it remains unclear who will inherit Ratan Tata's personal wealth, it is likely that his legacy, marked by humility and philanthropic endeavors through Tata Trusts, will continue to shape the future of the Tata Group."

The driver's six guidelines include requests for polite behavior, gentle door closing, and avoiding the term \"bhaiya\". Notably, he emphasizes that he owns the vehicle and that passengers should not expect him to drive recklessly to meet their deadlines.\n\nThe driver's request for respect has garnered support from some, who see it as setting clear boundaries and maintaining a professional environment. Others criticize the rules as overly strict and unreasonable, arguing that passengers should be free to enjoy their ride without feeling judged. \n\nThe most controversial rule prohibits calling the driver \"bhaiya\".  While some understand the driver's desire for professionalism, others argue that casual language is acceptable as long as respect is mutual.\n\nThis incident highlights a growing tension in service industries: the balance between customer expectations and service provider boundaries. While the driver's rules sparked debate, they raise the important question of how to foster a culture of mutual respect within transportation services."
