This positive performance led to a market capitalization of Rs 33,456 crore for the company.\n\nThe stock's strong performance in recent months, with a gain of 399% in two years and 199% in the past year, highlights investor confidence in the company's turnaround.

MCX shares are trading above all major moving averages.\n\nThe company's revenue from operations surged 73% to Rs 285.6 crore in Q2, driven by increased trading activity. EBITDA, a key profitability metric, also witnessed a significant increase, reaching Rs 179.4 crore compared to a loss of Rs 28.6 crore in the previous year's corresponding quarter.

        "news": "Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and vocal Trump supporter, has promised to give away $1 million a day to voters who sign a petition backing the Constitution. The initiative, part of his America PAC's efforts to boost Donald Trump's candidacy, has sparked concerns among election law experts.\n\nThe giveaway, which began in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, requires recipients to be registered voters. This has raised concerns about the legality of the initiative. While offering money for signing a petition might be acceptable, the requirement of voter registration creates a potential violation of the law.\n\nSome experts argue that the giveaway appears to incentivize voter registration, which is prohibited. They draw parallels to paying people for voting, which is explicitly illegal. The timing of the giveaway, just before the November 5th election, further amplifies these concerns.\n\nWhile Musk's PAC maintains the giveaway is aimed at promoting the Constitution and registering voters, legal challenges are likely to be raised. The Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign finance, has recently allowed some coordination between campaigns and Super PACs, but the specific legalities of this giveaway remain unclear. \n\nThe controversy highlights the complexities surrounding campaign finance and the blurring lines between voter registration and political spending. As the election approaches, the legal battle over Musk's million-dollar giveaway is set to continue."

In a letter to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) claims these platforms are offering deep discounts and selling below cost to attract customers. \n\nThe AICPDF argues that these practices are making it impossible for traditional retailers to compete, threatening their livelihoods.  They have urged the CCI to investigate and implement measures to protect traditional distributors and small retailers. \n\nThis move comes after the CCI found in August that larger e-commerce players, including Amazon and Flipkart, engaged in predatory pricing practices.  Quick commerce platforms are gaining popularity in India, with companies like Blinkit, Instamart, and Zepto promising deliveries within 10 minutes.  Industry analysts predict annual sales in the sector to exceed $6 billion this year."

        "news": "Ultratech Cement Ltd., India's leading cement producer, is set to announce its Q2FY25 results on October 21st, 2024.  Brokers anticipate a subdued quarter, with muted volume growth and pricing pressures impacting the company's performance.\n\nFactors hindering demand include delayed infrastructure projects post-elections, average monsoon with floods in some regions, and limited pricing power. However, brokerages expect demand to gradually recover, leading to price increases in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nAnalysts predict a decline in quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) performance, with weak realizations and Ebitda per tonne driving margin contraction.  While year-on-year (YoY) numbers may be less dismal, the monsoon season typically impacts Q2 performance for cement companies.\n\nNirmal Bang expects revenue of Rs 16,494 crore (up 3% YoY, down 8.7% QoQ), Ebitda of Rs 2,359 crore (down 7.5% YoY, 22.4% QoQ), and PAT of Rs 1,070 crore (down 16.4% YoY, 26.1% QoQ). They anticipate volumes to reach 30 million MT (up 12.5% YoY, down 6% QoQ) with realization per MT falling to Rs 5,492.\n\nSharekhan forecasts revenue of Rs 14,986 crore (down 3.4% YoY, 14.5% QoQ), with operational margin contraction to 13.7%.  They expect a net profit of Rs 884 crore (down 47% QoQ, 26.6% YoY), with volumes growing 4.5% YoY and realizations declining 7.6% YoY.\n\nAxis Securities expects revenue of Rs 15,383 crore (down 15% QoQ, 4% YoY), Ebitda of Rs 2,342 crore (down 23% QoQ, 8% YoY), and PAT of Rs 1,034 crore (down 39% QoQ, 19% YoY). They project YoY volume growth driven by new capacity ramp-up, but lower YoY revenues due to lower realization.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring the company's volume performance, realization trends, and Ebitda per tonne for insights into the future direction of the cement sector."

He also noted that his party has been advocating for the anthem's removal since 2016, stating that they would replace it if voted to power.\n\nThe NTK leader's remarks stem from a long-standing debate regarding the origin and meaning of the term \"Dravidam,\" which has been a source of political and social tension in the state.  Seeman's stance, however, is not widely shared, and his call for the anthem's removal is likely to face significant opposition."

Olcott, the Theosophical Society aimed to \"collect and diffuse knowledge of the laws which govern the universe.\"  After an initial stop in Bombay in 1877, the society established its headquarters in Adyar, Madras, purchasing the \"Huddleston Garden\" for \u00a3600. \n\nColonel Olcott proclaimed Adyar to be a \"sort of paradise,\" and the society, under his leadership, began to expand. Over the years, the building was transformed into the society's headquarters, with significant additions made in the 20th century. While Colonel Olcott laid the foundation, Dr. Annie Besant, who joined the society in 1889 and became president in 1903, played a key role in shaping the society's current form.\n\nThe society's vast property, now spanning over 253 acres, houses a remarkable collection of religious spaces: a temple, a Zoroastrian temple, a Buddhist vihara, a chapel, and a mosque. Its iconic Adyar Banyan Tree and the expansive Adyar Library and Research Centre, home to one of the world's largest book collections, further enhance its status as a cultural hub. Notably, the Scout Movement in India originated within the society in Madras."

Prof. Saibaba was imprisoned for a decade on charges of Maoist links under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967, before being acquitted earlier this year. \n\nDespite being confined to a wheelchair since childhood due to polio, Prof. Saibaba had no other health issues before his incarceration. However, he contracted swine flu while in prison and received inadequate medical care, according to activists.  His wife, Vasantha Kumari, has stated that his health deteriorated significantly due to the lack of proper medical attention during his imprisonment.\n\nActivists argue that the use of the UAPA, 1967, has been misused to unjustly incarcerate activists and dissidents, including Prof. Saibaba.  The case has highlighted the precarious situation individuals with disabilities face within the prison system.  \n\nThe death of Prof. Saibaba has renewed calls for reform within the prison system and scrutiny of the use of the UAPA, 1967."

This decision effectively dismantles the 16th Amendment, passed in 2014 during the tenure of deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which aimed to transfer the power of impeachment from the SJC to parliament.\n\nThe 16th Amendment was previously declared unconstitutional by a High Court bench in 2016. This decision was later upheld by a seven-judge Appellate Division bench in 2017, led by then Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha. The Hasina government subsequently sought a review of this decision, which was ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court on Sunday.\n\nThis ruling is a significant victory for judicial independence in Bangladesh, as it strengthens the judiciary's ability to operate free from political influence.

        "news": "The 200-year-old Konat Malpanate, a former training center for priests of the Syrian Orthodox Church, stands in dire need of preservation. Located in Pampakkuda, Kerala, the building housed students who lived alongside the Malpan (teacher) during their formation, mirroring the ancient Gurukula system.  \n\nThe two-story structure, now in a dilapidated state, has been passed down through generations of the Konat family, whose lineage of priests stretches back 23 generations.  The family is appealing to the State Archaeology department to help maintain this historical landmark, which offers a unique glimpse into the past of the Malankara Church.\n\nThe Malpanate's historical significance is underscored by its proximity to St. John's Orthodox Valiyapally, established in 1825, and two nearby tombs belonging to a bishop and four Malpans.  While the exact construction date remains unclear, the building's architecture and construction materials align with the nearby church, suggesting a shared history. \n\nThe Konat Malpanate represents a vital piece of Kerala's religious history, predating the Portuguese introduction of seminary-based education. This legacy deserves to be preserved for future generations, reminding us of the unique educational practices of the past and the enduring legacy of the Syrian Christian community."

        "news": "Kerala's regular foreign tourist season has begun, but optimism is tempered by a number of challenges. While the state is hoping to return to pre-COVID tourist numbers within two years, several factors threaten to hinder this goal.\n\n**Rising Costs & Competition:** The biggest hurdle is cost escalation. Hotel rates have increased by 20-25% post-COVID, and airfare has soared to 1,300-1,400 euros from 800 euros previously. This makes Kerala less attractive compared to cheaper destinations like Vietnam and Colombo, which offer similar luxury and comfort.  \n\n**Geopolitical & Domestic Issues:** The conflict in West Asia, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and diplomatic tensions between India and Canada are impacting tourist arrivals.  Furthermore, Kerala's lack of new tourism products, inadequate marketing campaigns, and financial constraints are further dimming prospects.\n\n**Industry Needs Synergy:** While private agencies play a major role in attracting tourists, there is a need for better synergy between the tourism department and the industry to foster a healthy tourist ecosystem. \n\nDespite these challenges, Kerala remains hopeful about attracting tourists.  The state witnessed a footfall of 6.5 lakh foreign tourists last year and believes that with concerted efforts, it can regain its pre-COVID tourism momentum."

Previously, parents had to travel to cities like Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad for treatment, a costly and time-consuming endeavor. \n\nThe center, named Sri Aditya Nilayam, offers free therapy, a welcome change for families who struggle to afford specialized care.

This means families still face significant financial burdens to access ongoing therapy.\n\nIRCS chairman P.

Frequent diversions and poorly maintained roads have made commuting through the area a nightmare for motorists.\n\nResidents like A. Pandiaraj complain about the lack of road re-laying after excavation, which leads to mud and water stagnation. S. Rajkumar, who runs an eatery near the junction, describes the area as a \"dust bowl\" due to the unlaid roads, making it difficult for both pedestrians and motorists. \n\nThe Coimbatore Corporation explains that the project involves replacing a damaged UGD line that burst two months ago. Instead of repairing the existing line, a new one is being installed, necessitating extensive digging. \n\nTo minimize further disruption, the Corporation is implementing a trenchless pipe-laying method for the remaining sections.  However, the project has faced delays due to the presence of existing drinking water pipelines and the collapse of soil during excavation. \n\nThe Corporation expects to complete the project within a month, aiming to alleviate the current traffic woes in Ramanathapuram Junction."

The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) claims that bank staff are facing harassment and violence from beneficiaries due to poor planning and communication from the government. \n\nIncidents of assault have been reported in various districts, with beneficiaries demanding access to the scheme's benefits. The UFBU is demanding improved security measures and additional staff to manage the influx of people seeking to activate accounts, link Aadhaar numbers, and open new accounts.\n\nThe Ladki Bahin Yojana, launched on August 17th, provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500 to women between the ages of 21 and 65 with an annual income below Rs 2.5 lakh. The scheme has been implemented in a similar fashion to the \"Ladli Behna Yojana\" in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe strike comes amidst the announcement of a Diwali Bonus under the scheme, which will provide qualifying women with Rs 3,000 in the form of the fourth and fifth installment payments. This bonus is seen as an attempt by the BJP-led government to gain favor with voters ahead of the Maharashtra state elections on November 20th."

His emphasis on strengthening planning at the state level was highlighted by State Planning Board Vice-Chairperson V.K. Ramachandran, who noted the widespread influence of Raj's work in various fields of Indian economics.\n\nThe CDS, recognized as the \"academic fountainhead\" of many of Kerala's key policy reforms, played a significant role in promoting democratic decentralization, according to former Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac. He cited Raj's early working paper on democratic decentralization as a cornerstone of the CDS's work and its engagement with public discourse.\n\nThe conference, which included presentations from prominent figures like former Union Cabinet Secretary K.M.

        "news": "The Indian government has issued new guidelines regarding the distribution of family pensions in cases where a deceased government servant or pensioner had multiple wives. These guidelines, outlined in Rule 50 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 2021, aim to ensure fairness and transparency in pension allocation.\n\n**The Key Provisions:**\n\n* **Equal Distribution:** If a deceased government servant had multiple legally recognized wives, the family pension will be divided equally among them.\n* **Inheritance by Children:** If one of the widows is no longer eligible or passes away, their share of the pension will be transferred to their eligible children. \n* **Legality of Second Marriage:** The guidelines emphasize the need to verify the legality of a second marriage, especially when a first wife is still alive. This verification will be conducted by the Department of Legal Affairs before any decisions are made about pension entitlement.\n* **Mandatory Guidance:** All ministries and departments are required to seek guidance from the Department of Legal Affairs in cases involving a government employee with two spouses. These cases must be reported promptly to the relevant pension benefits officer for resolution.\n\n**Enhanced Grievance Redressal System:**\n\nThe government has also introduced new measures to improve the handling of grievances from central government pensioners, focusing on a more sensitive, accessible, and effective complaint process. \n\nKey improvements include:\n\n* **Prompt Resolution:** Grievances will be resolved within 21 days, with interim responses provided for any delays.\n* **Appeal Process:** Unsatisfied applicants can file an appeal within 30 days, with a response guaranteed within another 30 days. \n* **Monthly Reviews:** Nodal Officers will conduct monthly reviews of pension-related complaints to ensure timely resolution and identify areas for improvement.\n\nThese new rules and grievance procedures aim to create a more transparent and efficient system for handling family pensions and addressing the concerns of central government pensioners."

        "news": "Several organizations in Nagapattinam have voiced their opposition to the municipality\u2019s decision to relocate the existing town bus stand to Sellur, a location on the outskirts of the town. Concerns have been raised that this move will negatively impact the local economy and reduce footfall in the town center.\n\nThe new bus stand is being constructed under the Kalaignar Nagarpura Membattu Thittam (KNMT) 2023-24. N.P. Bhaskaran, president of the Nagapattinam District Development Committee, expressed discontent over the lack of public consultation before the decision was made. He also highlighted the existing Anna Bus Stand, inaugurated in 1983, as a well-functioning facility that serves 230 buses daily and provides adequate amenities for passengers, officials, and businesses.\n\nInstead of moving the bus stand to Sellur, Mr. Bhaskaran advocates for expanding the current facility near the Auvurithidal grounds. K. Venkatesan, the town secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), echoes this sentiment. He emphasizes that relocating the bus stand would exacerbate the decline in foot traffic already caused by the relocation of other key public services such as the taluk office and government hospital outside the town center. This, he argues, would have a detrimental effect on the hundreds of shops that rely on the daily influx of visitors to the town.\n\nMr. Venkatesan suggests that the government continue operating some bus routes from the existing bus stand to mitigate the negative impact on local traders and commuters."

        "news": "Despite increased government investment, Kerala continues to face a healthcare paradox:  the state boasts the highest per capita government spending on health in India, yet its residents bear the highest out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAccording to the National Health Accounts (NHA) for 2021-22,  Kerala's per capita out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) on health reached \u20b97,889, significantly higher than Tamil Nadu's \u20b92,280. This is despite Kerala investing \u20b94,338 per capita in health, exceeding any other state. \n\nThe state allocates a significant 5.2% of its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to healthcare, totaling \u20b948,034 crore in 2021-22. However, over half of this expenditure is OOPE, indicating that Keralites still bear a considerable financial burden for healthcare services.\n\nThis trend has persisted since 2013-14, with increasing government health spending accompanied by a rise in OOPE. Experts attribute this to several factors, including an aging population, rising prevalence of lifestyle diseases, and a heavy reliance on private healthcare institutions.  \n\nWhile Kerala has invested heavily in improving public healthcare infrastructure and facilities, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns remain about the quality of care provided in public hospitals. This, coupled with the shortage of human resources, drugs, and supplies, has led many Keralites to seek care in the private sector, despite the high costs.\n\nThe government is urged to address the gap between healthcare investment and OOPE.  Investigating the shortcomings of public healthcare services and re-evaluating current policies is crucial to ensure that Kerala's healthcare system is truly accessible and affordable for all."

She claims the BJP's \"dirty politics\" have led to a rise in stubble burning in neighboring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, while untreated industrial wastewater from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is polluting the Yamuna River. \n\nAtishi cited data showing a decrease in stubble burning in Punjab, a state ruled by the AAP, and a simultaneous increase in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, both governed by the BJP. She also highlighted the presence of toxic froth on the Yamuna, attributing it to industrial wastewater discharged by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAtishi further blamed diesel buses from Uttar Pradesh, brick kilns in the National Capital Region (NCR), and thermal plants in the region for contributing to the poor air quality in Delhi. \n\nShe announced that the AAP government will start using silicone-based defoamers to address the froth issue on the Yamuna."

The video, which was shared on social media, has sparked debate about its strategic purpose and the potential impact on the ongoing conflict.\n\nThe video's release has raised questions about whether Israel was aware of Sinwar's location prior to the attack, and if so, why they did not target him. Some analysts suggest that the video may be intended to demonstrate Israeli intelligence capabilities and deter future attacks, while others believe it could be a propaganda tool to undermine Hamas leadership.\n\nThe video's significance is further highlighted by the fact that Sinwar's death would likely have a significant impact on the conflict. Some believe it could potentially lead to an escalation of violence, while others suggest it might facilitate negotiations and a ceasefire. \n\nThe video, along with various analyses and opinions, has been widely circulated by international news outlets including News18, The Times of India, NDTV, India Today, and The Guardian, highlighting the significant attention this event has garnered."

The loss leaves India needing a strong performance in the remaining matches to secure their spot in the final.\n\nCurrently, India sits atop the WTC points table with a 68.06% percentage. However, Australia closely trails them with a 62.50% percentage.  To qualify for the final, teams require at least a 60% win percentage. \n\nIndia now faces a challenging task. With 7 Tests remaining, they must win at least 4 and draw one to secure their spot. This includes winning the remaining two matches against New Zealand and at least two out of five against Australia. \n\nThe next two Tests against New Zealand will be crucial. A win in both matches will significantly boost India's chances, but failure to win could leave them battling for a final spot with Australia, Sri Lanka, and South Africa."

        "news": "The Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) provides a lifelong pension to individuals in India's organized sector.  To qualify for the pension, you must have worked for at least 10 years and retire at age 58.  \n\n**Calculating your pension:**\n\nThe pension amount is determined by the following formula:\n\n**(Pensionable Salary X Pensionable Service)/70**\n\n* **Pensionable Salary:** This is the average of your salary over the last 60 months of employment.\n* **Pensionable Service:** This is the total number of years you worked and contributed to the EPS.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf you joined EPS at 23 and retired at 58, contributing to the maximum wage ceiling of Rs. 15,000, you would receive a pension of approximately Rs. 7,500 after 35 years of service. This is calculated as: (15,000 x 35)/70 = Rs 7,500.\n\n**Early Pension:**\n\nYou can receive a reduced pension if you resign between the ages of 50 and 57. \n\n**Pension Upon Death:**\n\nUpon the death of an EPF member, the pension is automatically paid to their spouse. Children receive benefits until age 25, with a maximum of two children at a time.  Disabled children receive a lifetime pension in addition to the two child pensions.\n\n**Important Note:** Your employer's failure to contribute to the pension scheme does not impact your entitlement to a pension."
