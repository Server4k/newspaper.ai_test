        "news": "India's Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has ordered ride-hailing platform Ola to provide consumers with a choice of refund methods. Previously, Ola only offered a coupon code for future rides, even when consumers requested a bank account refund. The CCPA deemed this practice a violation of consumer rights. \n\nThe CCPA also found Ola's practice of not issuing invoices for rides to be an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019.  \n\nIn response to the CCPA's directives, Ola has made several changes to its platform, including: \n\n* Providing clear information on cancellation fees and reasons for cancellation.\n* Displaying the pickup and drop-off addresses to drivers.\n* Making the details of its grievance officer and nodal officer easily accessible.\n* Communicating with drivers to encourage the use of digital payments and air conditioning in vehicles. \n\nThese changes aim to improve transparency, accountability, and consumer satisfaction within Ola's services."
