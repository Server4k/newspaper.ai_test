Quick commerce is also anticipated to see strong growth with a 19% sequential GOV increase.\n* **Nykaa:**  Likely to gain market share in a challenging demand environment, driven by continued strength in core BPC and a gradual revival in fashion in the second half of FY25.\n* **CarTrade:**  New auto business expected to grow 9% sequentially and 21% YoY, with sustained strength in new auto sales and OEM ad spending. The remarketing segment is also set to recover.\n\n**Mixed Performance:**\n\n* **PB Fintech:** Core insurance premiums are projected to grow strongly, driven by health insurance and savings, although contribution margins may face further pressure.

Ebitda margin expansion is anticipated due to lower operational costs.\n\n**Other Highlights:**\n\n* **Affle India:**  Strong revenue growth expected due to recovery in developed markets, but India business is likely to see mid-teens growth.\n* **Route Mobile:**  Revenue growth driven by VI firewall deal and Telesign, but gross margins are expected to deteriorate due to lower margins in Telesign business.\n\nJM Financial's insights provide a valuable perspective on the current state of India's internet sector, offering insights into company-specific growth drivers, challenges, and future outlook.

        "news": "Shares of leading Indian auto manufacturers, including Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, and Tata Motors, experienced a sharp decline of up to 10% on Thursday, October 17th. This downturn was triggered by Bajaj Auto's underwhelming performance in the September 2024 quarter, which fell short of market expectations. \n\nThe Nifty auto index, which tracks the performance of leading auto stocks, plummeted by nearly 3%. The broader Nifty50 index also suffered, dropping over 150 points.\n\nBajaj Auto's share price crashed by 9.7%, driven by the company's muted Q2 results. While revenue grew by 22%, net profit rose only 9%, with analysts citing concerns about valuation. \n\nOther two-wheeler manufacturers also faced significant losses: TVS Motor Company dropped 6.25%, Hero MotoCorp declined over 5%, and Royal Enfield maker Eicher Motors shed 3.36%. \n\nCar manufacturers were not spared either. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) fell 3%, Maruti Suzuki dipped 2.5%, and Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland both dropped by 1%. \n\nAnalysts remain divided on the future outlook of these stocks. Some see opportunities in a potential 'buy on dip' scenario, while others advise caution, particularly with regards to highly valued two-wheeler stocks. \n\nTata Motors, despite recent production constraints, remains a 'BUY' for some analysts due to the company's anticipated recovery in the coming months. Similarly, Maruti Suzuki's bearish price action may signal a reversal in the stock's direction, presenting a potential opportunity for accumulation. \n\nDisclaimer: This article provides a summary of market information and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

The currency appreciated by a modest 3 paise to 83.99, supported by a combination of factors:\n\n* **Softening Oil Prices:** A recent decline in global oil prices, driven by weakening demand and easing tensions in the Middle East, has provided some relief for the rupee. \n* **RBI Intervention:**  Speculation of intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to support the rupee at lower levels has also contributed to its stability. \n* **Narrowing Trade Deficit:** India's trade deficit narrowed significantly in September, falling to $20.78 billion from $29.65 billion in August. A shrinking trade gap reduces pressure on the rupee, offering a temporary cushion.\n\nDespite these supportive factors, forex traders expect the rupee to trade within a narrow range throughout the day.  A strong dollar and a muted performance in domestic equities are exerting downward pressure on the Indian currency. \n\nKey economic data releases, such as the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy meeting and crucial US economic indicators, are likely to further influence the rupee's trajectory in the coming days."

The decline was attributed to the company's Q2 results, which fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nAnalysts cited a weak product mix as the primary driver behind the lower-than-expected margin, while the muted start to the festive season also contributed to the disappointing performance.  \n\nDespite the decline, Bajaj Auto's revenue grew by 22% year-on-year, driven by a 16% increase in volume to 12 lakh units.  However, lower-than-expected realization resulted in a slightly lower revenue increase than Nuvama's estimates.\n\nEmkay Global downgraded Bajaj Auto stock to \"Sell\" from \"Reduce,\" citing an unfavorable risk-reward profile following the recent rally, and recommending Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Ltd as better alternatives due to their respective growth prospects and risk-reward profiles.\n\nDespite the share price drop, Bajaj Auto has outperformed the Nifty Auto index over the past year, fueled by market share gains in the domestic 125cc+ motorcycle segment, improved margins, and a unique shareholder reward policy. \n\nWhile the stock appears fairly valued, MOFSL maintains a \"Neutral\" rating with a target price of Rs 11,450, while Nuvama revised their target price to Rs 13,200.  \n\nMoving forward, the company's capacity expansion and positioning of its CNG 2W will be key factors to watch, according to Sagar Shetty, Research Analyst at StoxBox."

        "news": "Amazon has entered the nuclear power race, signing agreements to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) to meet surging energy demands from its data centers. This move makes Amazon the latest tech giant to invest in nuclear power, joining companies like Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe company has partnered with X-Energy to conduct a feasibility study for an SMR project near a Northwest Energy site in Washington state. Amazon has secured the right to purchase electricity from four modules, with the potential for expansion to 960 MWs, enough to power over 770,000 U.S. homes.\n\nAmazon's investment in nuclear power underscores the growing need for reliable and scalable energy sources to power the ever-increasing demands of the data center industry. Artificial intelligence's rise has dramatically increased power consumption in recent years, leading tech companies to seek alternative energy solutions.\n\nWhile nuclear power offers a carbon-free alternative, the deployment of SMRs faces challenges. Critics argue that they are too expensive and that the U.S. lacks a permanent repository for the radioactive waste they produce. However, Amazon and X-Energy aim to bring over 5 gigawatts of SMR capacity online by 2039, representing the largest commercial deployment target for this technology to date."

        "news": "The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has announced the removal of the requirement for a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for obtaining new electricity connections in 1,731 unauthorised colonies. \n\nThis decision comes after numerous complaints from residents alleging they were forced to pay bribes to obtain the NOC from the DDA. Chief Minister Atishi accused the DDA of issuing the order mandating the NOC at the behest of the BJP-led central government. \n\nThe BJP, however, refuted these claims, stating that an NOC is only required for new colonies under development and that the responsibility for providing power connections lies with the Delhi government. \n\nThe move aims to ease the process for residents of unauthorised colonies who had been facing difficulties for the past year in obtaining electricity connections due to the NOC requirement. The AAP government believes the previous policy was designed to harass residents and create unnecessary hurdles. \n\nThis development has sparked a political debate between the ruling AAP and the opposition BJP ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi."

        "news": "The upcoming US Presidential election in November 2024 will see 240 million eligible voters choosing their next leader.  The race is expected to be particularly tight, with the outcome likely to be determined by the outcome in a handful of key states: **Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.** These are known as \"swing states\" because they are not consistently loyal to either the Republican or Democratic party, and therefore can shift their vote in any given election.\n\nWhile there are no specific features that define a swing state, there are key factors that contribute to their importance:\n\n* **Competitive nature:**  These states typically have a narrow margin of victory for the winning candidate, often less than 5%. This makes them highly contested and crucial for any campaign.\n* **Voter unpredictability:**  Voters in these states have shown a tendency to support different candidates in past elections, making their allegiance less predictable.\n* **Shifting demographics:** Factors such as jobs, immigration, and political polarization can influence voting patterns, leading to potential shifts in electoral support. \n\nThe importance of swing states is underscored by the fact that in the last eight presidential elections, 26 states were won by a margin of less than three points. These states are the battlegrounds where candidates focus their campaigns, resources, and messaging, hoping to win over voters who may be less entrenched in their party loyalties."

The KPCC is torn between accommodating Sarin's concerns and cracking down on what they see as a mutiny. \n\nThe party fears that disciplinary action against Sarin could portray him as a wronged leader and further alienate local party workers.

This article explores how purpose-led tech leaders are shaping organizations by focusing on the greater good, not just individual gain.\n\n**Three Key Aspects of Purpose-Led Tech Leadership:**\n\n1. **Empathy for Synergy:**  Effective leaders understand that listening is crucial. By understanding the visions, challenges, and expectations of stakeholders, they build a holistic perspective, leading to both short-term and long-term goals. Empathy allows leaders to leverage mutual capabilities and accelerate transformation for the greater good.\n\n2. **Forward Thinking for Impact:** Tech leaders must be futurists, anticipating market, technology, regulatory, and socio-economic shifts. They should understand the impact of technology on people and society, envisioning the \"future of work\" and reimagining technology accordingly. By collaborating with stakeholders and incorporating external best practices, they can build resilience for future disruptions.\n\n3. **Change Agents Driving Experiences:** Being a change agent requires balancing realism with foresight. While addressing stakeholder needs is essential, tech leaders must also guide organizations towards future-proofing their strategies. They must effectively communicate the value of technology, backed by data and tangible results. This approach not only focuses on financial returns but also prioritizes positive experiences for employees, contributing to successful tech implementation.\n\n**Beyond Individual Goals:** \n\nPurpose-led technology leadership is about continuously integrating these elements to foster trust and long-lasting impact. It involves:\n\n* Recognizing when to adopt a realist versus futurist perspective.\n* Allocating time effectively across both approaches.\n* Nurturing talent pipelines.\n* Managing complex relationships.\n\nUltimately, the intent behind actions is paramount.  Tech leaders who prioritize purpose are the ones who will truly shape the organizations of tomorrow."
