        "news": "Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is set to report its second-quarter earnings today, with analysts predicting a dip in net profit. \n\nJM Financial forecasts an 11% year-on-year (YoY) decline in profit, reaching Rs 15,518 crore, compared to Rs 17,394 crore in the same period last year. The decline is attributed to a weak performance in the core oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business due to low refining and petrochemical margins. \n\nWhile the O2C business is expected to dampen results, the consumer-facing businesses are projected to perform well.  All eyes will be on Jio's average revenue per user (ARPU) following the recent tariff hike. \n\nSeveral brokerages predict a decline in profit, ranging from 11% to 13%. Notably, ICICI Securities estimates Rs 15,400 crore in profit, while Nuvama expects Rs 15,120 crore.\n\nAnalysts are particularly interested in Jio's ARPU, with expectations ranging from Rs 188.70 to Rs 194.  This metric will provide insights into the success of the recent tariff increase and the impact on Jio's subscriber base. \n\nRIL is also expected to announce the record date for its 1:1 bonus share issue, the largest in Indian history, alongside the Q2 results."

This feat, which involved capturing a booster as tall as a 20-story building, marks a significant step towards SpaceX's goal of creating a fully reusable rocket for future space missions.\n\nThe launch took place at SpaceX's Boca Chica site in Texas, with the Super Heavy booster carrying the Starship second stage into space. After separating at an altitude of 70 km, the booster initiated its return to Earth, slowing down using three of its 33 engines. As it approached the launch pad, it landed on a tower taller than the Statue of Liberty, where two massive metal arms caught it by the steering fins. \n\nThis successful catch was hailed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who tweeted, \"The tower has caught the rocket!!\"  Engineers at the company's control center erupted in cheers as the booster was secured. \n\nWhile the booster capture was a triumph, the second stage, Starship, experienced a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia. However, the craft eventually tipped over and exploded in a fireball, leaving it unclear whether this was planned or a result of a fuel leak. Despite this, Musk deemed the landing \"precisely on target.\"\n\nThis test flight, approved by the FAA just a day prior, brings SpaceX closer to its ultimate goal of reusable rockets capable of transporting people and cargo to destinations like the moon and Mars. The successful capture of the Super Heavy booster is a testament to SpaceX's engineering prowess and a critical step towards realizing this ambitious vision."

This lack of enforcement fuels a culture of impunity, allowing information officers to disregard RTI requests and escape consequences.\n\n**Regressive Amendments and Privacy Concerns:** Recent amendments to the RTI Act have further weakened its effectiveness. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, broadens the scope of personal information exemption, limiting access to crucial data.  \n\n**Violence and Threats Against RTI Activists:** Worryingly, numerous individuals have been killed or threatened for using the RTI Act to expose corruption and wrongdoing. Despite the Whistleblowers Protection Act, the lack of implementation leaves activists vulnerable.\n\n**Erosion of Democracy:**  The RTI Act has played a crucial role in redistributing power and enhancing citizen participation in a democratic framework.  Undermining this fundamental right jeopardizes the very core of India's democracy."

The dispute stemmed from the omission of MLA Revuri's photo from flex banners erected in Dharmaram village to celebrate Dasara.\n\nAngered by the exclusion, Revuri's supporters tore down several banners, sparking a confrontation with the Minister's followers. The clash resulted in injuries to a few individuals.\n\nFollowing the incident, Geesugonda police apprehended some of those involved.  Minister Konda's supporters, accusing the police of bias, staged a protest in Dharmaram, blocking the Warangal-Narsampet highway and demanding the release of those detained.\n\nUpon learning of the incident, Minister Konda rushed to the Geesugonda police station, confronting officials over the arrests and demanding action against the officers involved.  The arrival of the Minister and her supporters created a tense atmosphere at the station.\n\nWarangal Police Commissioner Amber Kishore Jha intervened, assuring Minister Konda of a fair investigation into the matter. This eased tensions, and the Minister eventually left the station with her followers.\n\nA video circulating on social media platforms shows Minister Konda seated in the SHO's chair at the police station, adding fuel to the already tense situation."

This move signifies a significant escalation in US military support for Israel and a potential game-changer in the region's defense landscape.\n\nThe THAAD system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles in the upper atmosphere, is considered superior to Russia's S-400 system in many ways. Its effectiveness against long-range missiles makes it a powerful deterrent against potential threats from Iran, Hezbollah, and Yemen. \n\nThe THAAD system's hit-to-kill technology, which involves direct impact rather than explosive detonation, offers a high degree of accuracy. Its portability and long-range capabilities make it a flexible and strategic asset for Israel.\n\nThe decision to provide THAAD to Israel is likely motivated by a desire to counter Iran's growing missile capabilities and demonstrate a clear commitment to Israel's security."

The trenches, left open for over 15 days, are located near a government school, raising fears for children walking to and from school.\n\nThe recent rains have filled the trenches with water, and the lack of warning signs led to a four-wheeler getting stuck in one. A woman also fell into a trench, mistaking it for solid ground at night.  \n\nLocals have repeatedly requested officials from the Vadipatti taluk to close the trenches, which were dug during repairs to drinking water pipes.  Despite acknowledging the danger, officials have stated that the trenches will remain open until the pipes are replaced. \n\nWith continued rainfall, residents fear the situation will worsen and are urging immediate action to prevent accidents. A panchayat official has assured that all trenches will be closed within a week."

Balakrishnan Commission, which is currently examining the possibility of granting SC status to Dalits who have converted to religions other than Buddhism and Sikhism. \n\nThe organizations argue that the current amendment to Article 341, which grants SC status to converts to Buddhism and Sikhism, is discriminatory and violates the principles of equality and non-discrimination based on religion. They point out that several previous commissions have recognized that the disadvantages faced by Dalits persist regardless of their conversion to other religions. \n\nThe Commission is expected to hold public hearings in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to gather opinions on the matter. The outcome of the Commission's report could have a significant impact on the legal and social status of Dalit Christians in India."

The Corporation has deployed private water pumping vehicles to address the water stagnation.\n\nDespite recent efforts to improve drainage by clearing water channels along Avinashi Main Road and the Sanganoor canal, the persistent inundation problems remain. \n\nDistrict Collector Kranthi Kumar Pati and Corporation Commissioner Sivaguru Prabhakaran inspected waterlogged underpasses and instructed the Revenue Department and the Corporation to relocate residents of dilapidated houses and those whose homes were flooded to safer locations. The relocated residents will be provided with food, drinking water, and basic amenities.\n\nThe Coimbatore Corporation has announced helplines for residents to seek assistance with grievances related to the North-East Monsoon.

While smaller IT companies established a presence in the city over 20 years ago, growth has lagged behind other Tier-II cities like Coimbatore and Madurai. However, recent years have seen a surge in software and IT-enabled services, indicating a shift towards attracting larger IT industries.\n\nThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) notes a growing interest from companies to set up units in Tiruchirapalli. This growth is evident in the increasing employment opportunities offered by IT companies, especially in the ITES sector. Companies like Omega Healthcare, V. Dart, and Capgemini have hired a significant number of professionals.\n\nThe city's IT park, promoted by the Electronic Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT), along with numerous companies emerging in the Cantonment and Central Bus Stand areas, contribute to this growth. With an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 IT graduates employed in the city's IT and ITES sector, the availability of a skilled workforce is attracting further investment.\n\nA key factor driving this trend is the growing automation across industries, creating a stable demand for Tiruchirapalli-based companies. The city's access to experienced and rapidly learning young graduates further positions it as a potential IT hub. \n\nThe proposed TIDELPark, a joint venture between the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) and ELCOT, is anticipated to further boost the IT industry. This project, currently in its tendering stage, is expected to create a strong ecosystem for attracting larger IT companies to the city. With a combination of skilled talent, growing demand, and strategic infrastructure development, Tiruchirapalli is poised to become a prominent IT destination in the near future."

While many initially suspected dengue or chikungunya, tests have revealed a broader range of illnesses causing prolonged discomfort.\n\nDr. P. Saketa Reddy, a general physician in Hyderabad, notes that patients are experiencing unusually long recovery periods, with body aches lasting for over a month. The current outbreak is affecting all age groups, with persistent dry cough being another common symptom.\n\nAdding to the concerns, vector-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya remain a significant threat, with India witnessing a significant rise in these diseases in 2024. Hyderabad alone registered a 20% increase in dengue cases, reaching 30,000, while chikungunya cases stand at 15,000.\n\nDr. Hari Gopinath, a paediatrician, attributes this rise to urbanization, climate change, and poor sanitation, which have led to an increase in mosquito populations. This poses a particular risk to pregnant women, as a drop in platelet count and joint pain can lead to serious complications, requiring intensive care.\n\nWhile COVID-19 testing has declined, healthcare professionals emphasize the importance of seeking medical advice and avoiding self-medication, as symptoms often overlap with other seasonal illnesses.  The need for preventive measures such as mask-wearing, handwashing, and sanitizing is being highlighted once again, urging residents to remain vigilant and prioritize their health."

To avoid this fate, the brothers have established a clear division of responsibilities: Nikhil focuses on stock market-related activities, while Nithin manages people, broking, and product development. This ensures they don't step on each other's toes.  However, Nikhil acknowledges that despite their distinct roles,  \"egos come into play\" and \"misunderstandings happen.\" \n\nTheir solution?  A clear division of decision-making authority. Nikhil has the final say on all matters related to the stock market, while Nithin takes the lead on people, product, and broking.  This clear structure has helped them navigate disagreements effectively.\n\nInterestingly, Nithin, in a previous podcast episode, recognized Nikhil's superior trading abilities early on.  He credits Nikhil's initial trading success for building Zerodha without external funding.  Their complementary skills, coupled with a clear decision-making process, appear to be the formula for their successful partnership."

The violence, which has plagued the region for decades, is a result of ongoing conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslim tribes.\n\nThe latest incident saw a convoy of Sunnis, travelling under the protection of paramilitary soldiers, come under attack. The attackers, identified as Shiites, killed 14 people, including the women and children, before being killed by Frontier police. \n\nKurram, a former semi-autonomous area, has a long history of bloody confrontations between the two sects. The latest attack is just the most recent in a series of clashes in the region, with previous incidents in July and September claiming dozens of lives.\n\nWhile tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan, they are particularly violent and protracted in remote areas like Kurram, where traditional tribal honour codes are prevalent. The Shiite community, a minority in predominantly Sunni Pakistan, has long faced discrimination and violence. \n\nLocal officials are attempting to broker a truce, but the deep-seated animosity between the tribes and the history of violence make a lasting peace difficult to achieve."

        "news": "The Andhra Pradesh government has transferred the investigations into two high-profile attacks to the Crime Investigation Department (CID). These incidents involved attacks on the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) central office and the residence of former Chief Minister and TDP leader N. Chandrababu Naidu. \n\nThe Mangalagiri police initially investigated the TDP office attack, which occurred in October 2021, and filed charges against 110 individuals.  The Tadepalli police investigated the attack on Naidu's residence in September 2021, with accusations leveled against YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leaders, including former Minister Jogi Ramesh, ex-MP Nandigam Suresh, and YSRC leaders Lella Appireddy, Devineni Avinash, and Talasila Raghuram.  \n\nThe decision to hand the cases over to the CID comes after tensions between the TDP and YSRCP escalated during the period of these attacks.  While the police have already arrested some individuals linked to the attacks, the CID will now conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of involvement of those charged and uncover any further details surrounding the incidents."

        "news": "Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has defended the state government's decision to withdraw 43 cases related to the 2022 Hubballi riots, stating that the move is based on a recommendation from a cabinet sub-committee. The CM claims that the cases were deemed false after review and that the BJP's planned protests against the decision are baseless.\n\nSiddaramaiah emphasized that the cases will only be withdrawn after receiving approval from the court. He further pointed out that some of the cases involve BJP leaders, adding credence to his argument against the BJP's protest.\n\nDespite the CM's claims, BJP leaders have staged a protest, displaying black flags and expressing their opposition to the withdrawal of the cases. The protests were met with police intervention, resulting in the detention and subsequent release of some BJP activists.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the withdrawal of these cases has raised questions about political motivations and the potential for selective justice. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions between the ruling Congress party and the opposition BJP in Karnataka."
