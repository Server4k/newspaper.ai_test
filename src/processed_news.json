        "news": "India's Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has ordered ride-hailing platform Ola to give customers a choice between receiving refunds directly to their bank accounts or via coupons. This follows complaints that Ola's \"no-question-asked\" refund policy only offered coupon codes for future rides, which the CCPA deemed a violation of consumer rights.\n\nThe CCPA also found Ola's practice of not providing receipts for rides to be an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. \n\nIn addition to these changes, the CCPA has ordered Ola to:\n\n* Clearly display the cancellation policy and fees at the time of booking.\n* Show drivers the pickup and drop-off locations before accepting the ride.\n* Provide a list of fare components, including base fare, per km fare, and waiting charges.\n* Encourage drivers to accept digital payments and use air conditioning.\n* Shorten payment cycles for drivers.\n\nThese actions come after 2,061 complaints were filed against Ola on the National Consumer Helpline between January 1st and October 9th, 2024. The most common complaints involved higher fares than those shown during booking, non-refunded amounts, driver requests for additional cash, and incorrect pick-up or drop-off locations.\n\nThe CCPA's intervention aims to improve transparency, accountability, and consumer trust in Ola's services."
