        "news": "Southern Railway has significantly improved safety on the Tiruchirapalli - Dindigul rail line by replacing two vulnerable causeways with new bridges. Located near the Koraiyar river, the bridges (No. 1142A and 1143A) were constructed using precast reinforced cement concrete twin boxes. This design prevents water from overflowing onto the track during the monsoon season, a problem previously encountered with the causeways. \n\nThe \u20b99 crore project, completed before the start of the northeast monsoon, involved meticulous planning to minimize disruption to train services. The new bridges, measuring 64.40 meters and 55.20 meters in length, were constructed efficiently utilizing line and power blocks for key stages.  \n\nThe project commenced in September 2024 and concluded in October with the completion of track work.  This infrastructure upgrade enhances safety by allowing water to flow freely beneath the bridges, eliminating the risk of flooding on the track.  Previously, watchmen were deployed during heavy rains to monitor the vulnerable causeways, highlighting the need for a permanent solution. The new bridges effectively address this issue, providing a safer and more reliable rail infrastructure."

While many initially suspected dengue or chikungunya, tests have shown that these diseases are not the primary culprit. Instead, a combination of viral fevers and mosquito-borne illnesses are causing widespread discomfort.\n\nThe most common symptom is persistent joint pain, lasting for weeks, even after fever subsides. This unusual trend has alarmed healthcare professionals, as it differs from previous years.  \n\nWhile mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya remain a significant threat, the increased transmission of viral fevers is also contributing to the outbreak. \n\nThe surge in seasonal illnesses is attributed to a number of factors, including urbanization, climate change, and poor sanitation. The monsoon season has further aggravated the situation, boosting mosquito populations and increasing the risk of disease transmission. \n\nVulnerable groups, particularly pregnant women, are at a heightened risk.  Prolonged symptoms, including joint pain and a drop in platelet count, can lead to critical complications, potentially requiring ICU admissions. \n\nThe rise in seasonal illnesses has prompted calls for increased vigilance and preventive measures.  While COVID-19 testing has decreased, the similarity in symptoms between COVID and other illnesses highlights the importance of seeking medical advice and avoiding self-medication. \n\nHealthcare professionals emphasize the need for heightened awareness and adherence to preventive measures, such as mask-wearing, handwashing, and sanitation, to help curb the spread of these diseases."

This surprising partnership saw Israel provide Iran with modern military equipment, including fighter jets, and even provide military training.\n\nThe relationship was motivated by mutual interests. Both countries saw Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, as a common enemy. Israel, fearing Iraq's potential nuclear capabilities, sought to weaken its adversary. In return, Iran provided Israel with intelligence on Iraq's nuclear program,  allowed the migration of Persian Jews to Israel, and served as a market for Israeli weapons. \n\nWhile the exact details of this clandestine trade remain shrouded in secrecy, estimates suggest that Israel sold Iran weapons worth $500 million annually during the Iran-Iraq War.

        "news": "Fed up with frequent cancellations, Bengaluru commuters are increasingly turning to electric vehicle (EV) cab services like BluSmart, Quick Ride, Envi, and Shoffr.  While slightly more expensive and requiring pre-booking, these services offer a key advantage: reliability.\n\nThe shift is driven by frustration with traditional ride-hailing apps like Ola and Uber.  Commuters report consistent cancellations, especially during peak hours, leaving them stranded and scrambling for alternative transportation.  EV cab services, on the other hand, provide a more dependable experience.\n\nThe reason for their greater reliability lies in their operational model. Unlike traditional cab services where drivers often own their vehicles, EV cab companies typically own their fleet. This removes the financial burden of maintenance and loan repayments from drivers, allowing them to focus solely on driving.  Drivers report feeling less pressured to cancel rides due to financial concerns, resulting in greater reliability for passengers.\n\nBeyond reliability, EV cabs are also attracting customers due to their environmental friendliness.  Passengers feel good about contributing to a cleaner city by choosing electric transportation.  While the switch to electric cabs is gaining momentum, challenges remain.  The primary hurdle is a shortage of vehicles.  With demand outpacing supply, securing an EV cab can be difficult, particularly during peak hours.  This limitation could hinder further growth unless the fleet size increases to meet rising demand. \n\nOverall, the growing popularity of EV cabs in Bengaluru reflects a shift towards a more reliable and sustainable transportation model.  As the demand for these services continues to grow, the availability of electric vehicles will be key to ensuring their success."

The incident occurred on Saturday, October 12, 2024, when a convoy of Sunni Muslims traveling under paramilitary protection was attacked by suspected Shiite militants in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nKurram, a historically volatile region, has been plagued by intermittent fighting between Sunni and Shiite tribes for several months. This latest attack is just the most recent in a series of violent confrontations that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. \n\nThe violence is rooted in long-standing sectarian tensions and tribal feuds, common in Pakistan's remote regions where traditional honor codes are prevalent. The Shiite community in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni country, faces discrimination and violence.\n\nFollowing the attack, Frontier police responded, killing two of the attackers. Officials are currently attempting to broker a truce following previous ceasefires mediated by tribal councils."

Meanwhile, the Tadepalli police investigated the incident at Naidu's residence, where protestors threw stones, leading to tensions in the area. \n\nThe cases involve accusations against several prominent figures, including former Minister Jogi Ramesh, ex-MP Nandigam Suresh, and YSRC leaders Lella Appireddy, Devineni Avinash, and Talasila Raghuram.  \n\nThe police have already arrested several individuals, including Nandigam Suresh and supporters of Jogi Ramesh.  \n\nThe transfer of these cases to the CID suggests a desire for a more thorough investigation and potentially a higher level of scrutiny given the political figures involved."

This sub-committee, he emphasized, has been in place throughout previous BJP administrations, and they too have withdrawn several cases during their tenure. \n\nDespite the CM's explanation, a few BJP leaders staged a protest against the decision by displaying black flags on Airport Road in Hubballi.

Veena, daughter of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) in Chennai has sparked intense political debate in Kerala. The SFIO investigation, ordered by the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs, centers on suspected illegal transactions between CMRL (Cochin Minerals and Rutile Limited) and Veena's IT consultancy firm, Exalogic. \n\nThe Congress party has labeled the SFIO probe an \"eyewash,\" alleging a political motive behind the investigation, particularly in the run-up to crucial by-elections in Kerala. The CPI(M), however, maintains the transactions were legitimate and that the questioning of Veena was merely procedural.\n\nThe SFIO probe was initiated following an Interim Board for Settlement (IBS) finding in 2023, which concluded that Exalogic had received a sizeable retainer from CMRL without providing any tangible services, raising concerns about the payments' nature. Consequently, the Enforcement Directorate also launched an anti-money-laundering investigation against Exalogic and CMRL.\n\nWhile the Kerala Chief Minister defended his daughter's business dealings in 2023, the BJP has accused the Vijayan family of being under scrutiny from the law, vowing that justice will prevail. The investigation is likely to dominate the political discourse in Kerala, with both the ruling CPI(M) and the opposition parties using it as ammunition in their campaigns."

        "news": "Taiwan's Ministry of Defense confirmed the presence of a Chinese navy group led by the aircraft carrier Liaoning in waters near the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines. This development comes amidst heightened tensions between Taiwan and China, fueled by a recent speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te. \n\nThe Liaoning carrier group is expected to enter the Western Pacific. Taiwan's armed forces are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining a \"vigilant and appropriate response.\"  \n\nAdding to the tense atmosphere, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command, responsible for Taiwan's region, released a propaganda video titled \"fully prepared and biding ones time before battle.\"  The video showcased fighter jets, warships, mobile missile launchers, and amphibious assault vehicles, with a subtle map of Taiwan embedded in the title. This video serves as a visual demonstration of China's military readiness. \n\nPresident Lai, considered a \"separatist\" by Beijing, has maintained a firm stance against Chinese sovereignty claims over Taiwan, asserting that only Taiwan's people have the right to decide their future.  China views Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out using force to achieve unification. \n\nThe Liaoning's presence and the PLA's video underscore the escalating military tensions between China and Taiwan. This situation raises concerns about a potential new round of Chinese war games, following the ones held in May in response to President Lai's inauguration speech."

The lack of proper road signage, haphazard parking, and hawker encroachment exacerbate the issue. \n\nLocal residents point to the absence of effective enforcement by the authorities as the primary cause.  While the Puducherry Road Safety Council has repeatedly acknowledged the problem and pledged to address it, no concrete measures have been taken to date.  \n\nThe predicament on Nehru Street highlights a larger issue in Puducherry:  a severe lack of dedicated pedestrian infrastructure.  According to an official, only 10% of Puducherry's roads have footpaths, and over 84% of those are encroached upon. \n\nWith increasing traffic congestion and minimal designated walking space, residents fear for their safety, raising concerns about the government's commitment to creating a pedestrian-friendly environment."

However, the hurricane's aftermath has become a political flashpoint, with former President Donald Trump and his allies attacking the Biden administration's response. \n\nHarris's events will be focused on both recovery efforts and campaign issues. On Saturday, she will meet with African American leaders in Raleigh and work with volunteers preparing relief supplies for hurricane victims. Her Sunday church visit in Greenville is part of a \"Souls to the Polls\" initiative aimed at increasing voter turnout among African American communities. \n\nThe campaign rally on Monday will focus on the economy, a key issue for voters in the upcoming election. The event comes as early voting begins in North Carolina on Thursday. \n\nHarris has also been vocal about combating price gouging, which has become an issue in the wake of the hurricanes. She has vowed to hold companies accountable for any attempts to take advantage of shortages caused by the natural disasters."

        "news": "The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has released a report on demographic changes in Jharkhand's Santhal Pargana region, attributing a range of problems to \"Bangladeshi infiltration.\" The report, which was submitted to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, recommends engaging NGOs to address this alleged issue.\n\nThe NCST report claims that demographic changes over the past seven decades have been fueled by illegal immigration from Bangladesh. This directly contradicts the Union government's position, as expressed in a recent Home Ministry affidavit before the Jharkhand High Court. The report, however, acknowledges the difficulty in accurately enumerating the number of \"Bangladeshi infiltrators\" due to fluctuating figures and limitations in official records.\n\nThe report further links several issues raised by local Adivasis to \"illegal immigration,\" including lack of government scheme penetration, land disputes, human trafficking, missing girls, and cybercrime. It also alleges that sacred Adivasi land is being converted into Muslim cemeteries and cites instances of \"Bangladeshi Muslims\" acting as middlemen to prevent Adivasis from accessing government benefits.\n\nThe report's claims have been met with criticism.  Jharkhand has no international border, and Pakur district, which the report alleges shares a border with Bangladesh, actually borders West Bengal. Furthermore, the 2021 Census has been indefinitely postponed. \n\nThe report relies heavily on anecdotal evidence gathered from conversations with locals, with details such as the time and location of alleged incidents often missing. Some claims, like the alleged forced marriages of Adivasi women to \"Bangladeshi Muslims,\" have been previously refuted by the women involved. \n\nThe NCST's report has fueled the ongoing debate on demographic changes in Santhal Pargana, which has become a focal point in the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections. While the Opposition BJP cites \"illegal immigration\" as the root cause, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha places the onus on the Centre to curb such immigration."

Both leaders used the recent Dasara rallies to solidify their positions, each targeting the other with sharp criticisms. \n\nUddhav Thackeray, former Chief Minister and head of the Shiv Sena (UBT), declared himself as the CM candidate for the upcoming elections. He vowed to prevent \"Modi, Shah, and Adani\" from taking control of Maharashtra, claiming that the current BJP-led government was focused on power rather than the well-being of the state.  He also appealed to the RSS to introspect on its support of the BJP, accusing the party of trying to \"finish off\" his faction of the Shiv Sena. \n\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, leader of the other Shiv Sena faction, launched a scathing attack on Thackeray, questioning his ability to lead and highlighting his perceived failures during his tenure. He pointed to the \"speedbreakers\" put on development projects during Thackeray's leadership and touted his own government's achievements, including financial assistance for farmers and job training programs.  \n\nBoth sides took aim at the Dharavi redevelopment project, with Thackeray vowing to cancel it if elected and Shinde accusing Thackeray of opposing the project while supporting lavish bungalows. \n\nThis escalation of conflict sets the stage for a highly polarized election campaign in Maharashtra, where the battle lines are drawn not only between political parties but also within a party that once held significant sway in the state."

PMK founder S. Ramadoss criticizes the DMK for failing to provide jobs for youth, despite promises of 5.5 lakh new positions. He also accuses the government of neglecting its promise to prioritize local youth in private sector hiring.\n\nFurthermore, the PMK condemns the government's inaction on conducting a caste-based census, a move deemed essential by the party to safeguard reservations for various communities. The PMK also criticizes the DMK's decision to increase electricity tariffs, property tax, water tax, and other fees, citing a disproportionate burden on the poor.\n\nRamadoss concludes by stating that the DMK government's policies have been detrimental to the people and that it is time for a change in leadership. The rallies are intended to highlight these grievances and galvanize public opinion against the ruling party."

India, however, did not join the chorus of international disapproval, choosing to remain silent on the matter. \n\nThe letter, circulated by Chile and supported by nations like Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Uganda, Indonesia, Spain, Guyana, and Mexico, highlights the importance of respecting the UN's leadership and mission. It reinforces the international community's support for Guterres and his work, emphasizing the detrimental impact of Israel's actions on the UN's ability to mediate conflicts and provide humanitarian aid.\n\nIndia's decision to abstain from signing the letter is particularly noteworthy given its past record of abstaining from resolutions critical of Israel. This decision, however, stands out as a departure from the general consensus, as the letter focuses on defending the UN itself and not on taking sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIsrael's ban on Guterres was issued by Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who accused the Secretary General of failing to criticize Iranian missile strikes on Israel unequivocally. This accusation, however, contradicts Guterres' statements on Iran's actions, both before and after the ban. \n\nThe UN Security Council has also publicly expressed support for Guterres, issuing a statement last week criticizing any decision not to engage with the Secretary General as counterproductive, especially in the context of escalating tensions in the Middle East. \n\nWhile the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has declined to comment on India's decision, its spokesperson stated on October 4 that India considers Guterres the UN Secretary General and refrains from commenting on the actions of third parties."

This innovative technique is proving to be a lifeline for those living in low-lying areas where floodwaters regularly invade their homes.\n\nFollowing the devastating floods of 2015 and 2017, the demand for house-lifting services has surged. Companies like R. Yuga Balan's are witnessing a boom in inquiries, particularly from residents near lakes where road levels have risen.\n\nThe process typically involves raising the house by using hydraulic jacks and filling the space with sand or gravel. The cost can vary but starts around \u20b93 lakh for the first three feet and \u20b950,000 for every additional foot.\n\nWhile this method appears simple and effective, it's not without considerations. Older buildings require structural assessments to ensure safety, and the elevation needs to be carefully calculated to maintain accessibility. However, experts like Benny Raphael, head of the Civil Engineering department at IIT-Madras, assure that the process does not weaken the structure.\n\nThe recent lifting of the Sri Utthara Guruvayoorappan Temple in Nanganallur serves as a testament to the effectiveness of this solution. Following years of flooding issues, the temple was raised 5.5 feet and is now prepared to face the monsoon season.\n\nThe rising popularity of house-lifting in Chennai highlights the need for proactive flood mitigation strategies. While this innovative technique offers immediate relief, long-term solutions are crucial to address the root causes of flooding and ensure the safety and well-being of residents."

        "news": "Managing diabetes effectively involves controlling blood sugar levels throughout the day, including nighttime. Here are 5 tips to help regulate glucose levels before bedtime:\n\n1. **Choose Wisely: Evening Snacks**\n\n   Avoid sugary snacks and opt for protein-rich or fiber-rich options like nuts, Greek yogurt, or carrot sticks with hummus. These snacks help stabilize blood sugar without causing spikes.\n\n2. **Embrace Consistency: Sleep Schedule**\n\n   Establish a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Consistent sleep helps regulate hormones controlling appetite and blood sugar, preventing insulin resistance.  \n\n3. **Turn Off the Screens: Limit Screen Time**\n\n   The blue light emitted from electronic devices can disrupt melatonin production, making sleep difficult. Turn off screens at least 30 minutes before bed and opt for relaxing activities like reading or meditation.\n\n4. **Stay Hydrated, But Not Too Much:**\n\n   While hydration is important, limit fluid intake in the hour before bed. Drinking too much water can lead to nighttime bathroom trips, disrupting sleep.\n\n5. **Monitor Your Blood Sugar: Before Bed**\n\n   Before going to bed, check your blood sugar levels. This helps understand your body's response to food, medication, and daily activities. Adjust your evening meal or insulin dosage if needed, aiming for a blood sugar level within your target range.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can significantly improve your nighttime blood sugar control and prevent spikes. Remember to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs."

        "news": "BJP leaders in Karnataka have condemned the state government's decision to withdraw cases against individuals accused of rioting in Hubballi. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi labelled the move as an example of the Congress party's appeasement of minority groups, stating that such policies will ultimately result in widespread chaos. \n\nJoshi also criticized the state government's claims of inadequate resource allocation from the Centre, arguing that the state is mismanaging its finances rather than facing genuine shortcomings. \n\nMLA Aravind Bellad echoed Joshi's sentiment, calling the decision to withdraw the cases a dangerous precedent and vowing to fight it legally. He accused the Congress government of encouraging criminal elements and prioritizing appeasement over justice. \n\nMLA Mahesh Tenginakai expressed concerns about the impact on police morale, suggesting that the withdrawal of charges against individuals involved in violent clashes would undermine law enforcement and potentially lead to further unrest. \n\nFormer MLA Amrut Desai raised further concerns, highlighting the lack of action taken against Congress leader Vinay Kulkarni despite serious allegations against him. He called for Kulkarni's immediate arrest and the transfer of the case to the CBI. \n\nThe BJP's strong condemnation of the state government's actions underscores the ongoing political tensions surrounding law and order in Karnataka, with the party accusing the Congress of prioritizing appeasement over justice and accountability."

This information, reported by News18, suggests a deeper level of Iranian involvement in the conflict than previously known. \n\nThe revelation comes amidst ongoing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, with speculation about the possibility of another conflict in the region. The use of pagers, while seemingly outdated technology, could have played a critical role in Hezbollah's communication during the war, potentially facilitating coordinated attacks and troop movements. \n\nThe former IRGC officer's statement, if accurate, raises serious questions about the extent of Iranian support for Hezbollah and its impact on regional stability.

        "news": "Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai has taken a significant step forward in healthcare by inaugurating an advanced vertigo lab. The lab features videonystagmography, a cutting-edge technology that measures involuntary eye movements, enabling precise diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders.\n\nThe lab's technology will help diagnose conditions like BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), Meniere\u2019s disease, vestibular migraine, and vestibular neuritis. This, in turn, helps doctors avoid prolonged drug use for vertigo by providing an accurate and early diagnosis, leading to more effective treatment.\n\nVertigo, a sensation of spinning or dizziness, is often caused by problems in the inner ear's vestibular system. This system is responsible for maintaining balance and spatial orientation.\n\nThe videonystagmography test tracks eye movements (nystagmus) in response to various stimuli, like head position changes or visual cues. This helps identify abnormalities in the vestibular system, leading to an accurate diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan, which may include physical therapy, medication, or lifestyle modifications.\n\nThe test, which takes about 30 to 60 minutes, is currently offered free of charge at GRH, while it costs between \u20b9 4000 to \u20b9 5000 in private hospitals. The hospital plans to upgrade the testing facility in the future."

This has led to student and political party protests, demanding the college's immediate opening.\n\nThe college, built at a cost of \u20b95 crore, was meant to address the lack of government B.Ed. options in Salem, forcing students to attend private institutions in nearby towns. While the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the opening initially, the college has not yet received the necessary approval from the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE). \n\nThe college's infrastructure is currently unused, with buildings overgrown and potentially capable of accommodating 200 students. Both the AIADMK and DMK governments have been criticized for their inaction. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) student wing has threatened protests if the college does not open soon.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University (TNTEU) is currently working to obtain the required clearances. The delay highlights the ongoing struggle for access to affordable and quality education in rural areas."
