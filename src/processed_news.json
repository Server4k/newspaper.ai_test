The woman's body was found in a pond near Vedaranyam a few days prior.\n\nShanmuganathan, who was out on bail in the POCSO case, was taken into custody after an investigation revealed his involvement in the murder. He had allegedly attempted suicide on the same morning as the woman's death.\n\nThe deceased woman was the mother of the 11-year-old girl who had accused Shanmuganathan of attempted sexual assault. Police believe the murder was an act of retaliation for the POCSO complaint.\n\nShanmuganathan has been arrested from Nagapattinam Government Medical College Hospital and is currently lodged in Tiruchi Central Prison."

        "news": "A Coimbatore-based startup, Eco Petals, is tackling the issue of flower waste by transforming unsold flowers into charcoal-free incense sticks. Founded by two young entrepreneurs, Kinjal Jain and Hardhik Sonu, Eco Petals aims to create a more sustainable and ethical incense industry. \n\nThe startup purchases unsold flowers from Coimbatore's flower market, preventing them from being discarded. These flowers are then sorted, dried, pulverized, and blended with essential oils and natural binding agents to create incense sticks. Eco Petals' unique approach utilizes fresh flowers, making them a pioneer in this market. \n\nThe company employs predominantly older women from rural areas, providing them with steady income and a comfortable working environment.  Their incense sticks are marketed as a cleaner alternative to traditional charcoal-based incense, offering a natural fragrance with four scents: rose, marigold, jasmine, and lavender. \n\nWhile producing incense from fresh flowers is more labor-intensive and expensive, Eco Petals is committed to scaling its operations both within India and internationally. The company is currently focused on online sales but plans to expand into offline channels, such as organic stores. \n\nEco Petals' branding emphasizes cultural nostalgia, featuring a grandmother as its mascot, symbolizing the heart and soul of their brand.  The startup's success is closely tied to its local partnerships with flower market vendors, with plans to further expand these collaborations in the future."

        "news": "Telangana's local bodies are facing delays in receiving grants recommended by the XV Finance Commission. The reason? The XIV Finance Commission made it mandatory for only \"duly elected\" panchayats to receive these funds. Unfortunately, Telangana's local body elections haven't been held yet, leaving them under the control of special officers.\n\nThe state has been allocated \u20b97,201 crore during the XV Finance Commission's five-year period (2021-22 to 2025-26). However, the delay in elections is a major hurdle. The state recently announced a door-to-door survey aimed at enumerating backward classes for reservation purposes in local body elections. This process, along with the finalization of reservations, is expected to take significant time, further delaying the elections. \n\nFurthermore, the Finance Commission has set specific conditions for receiving the grants. These include publishing provisional and audited accounts publicly, setting minimum floor rates for property taxes, and improving property tax collection for urban local bodies. \n\nThe State Finance Commission, formed in February 2024, has also failed to submit its recommendations before the deadline, further hindering the release of the grants. This creates a complex situation with multiple factors contributing to the delay in the release of much-needed funds for local bodies in Telangana."

        "news": "Hyundai Motor India's upcoming IPO, set to launch on October 15th, is poised to be a record-breaking event. However, concerns about its listing performance are growing due to a falling grey market premium (GMP). This suggests a potentially underwhelming debut, adding to the trend of mega-IPOs failing to deliver strong returns on Dalal Street.\n\nWhile the IPO aims to raise a massive Rs 27,856 crore, the declining GMP, currently at just Rs 45 per share, indicates a potential listing gain of only 2%. This stark contrast with the initial GMP of Rs 65 highlights the waning investor enthusiasm. \n\nHistorically, many mega-IPOs have resulted in wealth destruction, with most listing at a discount.  The only exception among IPOs exceeding Rs 9,500 crore since 2010 was Coal India. Notable underperformers include LIC, Paytm, and General Insurance Corporation of India, all of which listed with negative returns. \n\nThe IPO's entirely offer-for-sale (OFS) nature, where existing shareholders sell their shares, raises further concerns. This is reminiscent of LIC and Paytm, both of which included a large OFS component and resulted in losses for investors. \n\nDespite Hyundai's strong position as India's second-largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, its IPO is facing headwinds. While the company enjoys operational superiority, a potential slowdown in the PV industry in FY25 and a lack of participation in the MPV segment pose challenges. \n\nWhile Hyundai's IPO is likely to attract retail investors seeking allotments due to its large size, experts advise caution and thorough evaluation before investing. The current market sentiment, characterized by ample liquidity, may contribute to the underwhelming performance. \n\nUltimately, the IPO's success hinges on a strong post-listing demand, which remains uncertain given the historical trend of mega-IPOs failing to deliver significant returns."

        "news": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the Congress party's top leadership of being involved in corruption related to land transactions. This allegation follows a trust linked to Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge's family withdrawing its request for a five-acre civic amenity site in Bengaluru. \n\nBJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi claimed that the withdrawal, along with the return of 14 sites by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's wife, were motivated by fear of legal proceedings and adverse CAG reports. Trivedi asserted that this amounted to an admission of wrongdoing and urged the Congress leaders to resign on moral grounds.\n\nHe further alleged that the Congress, once associated with land donation, is now deeply involved in land grabbing under the leadership of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. He cited the ongoing National Herald case, where the Gandhis are accused of acquiring company properties at a nominal price, as further evidence of their alleged corruption. \n\nTrivedi also pointed to allegations of land grabbing against other Congress leaders, including former Chief Ministers Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel, and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar.\n\nThe BJP's accusations come amidst a flurry of recent developments involving Congress leaders and land deals. This has fueled a political battle between the two parties, with the BJP using the allegations to attack the Congress's credibility."

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) released a statement on Monday, calling the accusations \"preposterous imputations\" and attributing them to the \"political agenda\" of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government.\n\nThe MEA alleges that Canada has not provided any evidence to support its claims and has instead used the investigation as a \"deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.\" They further accused Trudeau of providing a platform for \"violent extremists and terrorists\" who have harassed Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada.\n\nThis latest development further strains the already tense bilateral relationship.  In September 2023, Trudeau accused \"Indian agents\" of being behind Nijjar's murder, leading to a series of retaliatory actions from India, including the suspension of visa processing for Canadian citizens and the withdrawal of 41 Canadian diplomats. \n\nIndia has repeatedly denied any involvement in Nijjar's death and argues that the allegations are politically motivated, particularly as Trudeau faces domestic political pressure. The MEA cited instances dating back to 2018, where Trudeau's ministerial council included individuals with \"violent and secessionist elements\" who sought to undermine India's interests. \n\nThe escalating diplomatic row highlights the growing complexities of the relationship between India and Canada, fueled by concerns over pro-Khalistan activism and allegations of foreign interference."

        "news": "Two prominent Indian investors, Ashish Dhawan and Akash Bhanshali, have reduced their stakes in Arvind Fashions, a leading fashion retailer that has seen its stock price more than double in the past year. While Dhawan has maintained a steady stake for the past two years, Bhanshali completely exited the company in the September 2024 quarter.\n\nThis move has sparked some speculation among investors. Arvind Fashions boasts a diverse portfolio of popular brands, including Arrow, Tommy Hilfiger, Flying Machine, Calvin Klein, and US Polo Assn. It has been performing well, with analysts predicting strong growth in the coming years due to its strategic focus on core brands and the increasing casualization of fashion trends.\n\nWhile the reason behind the investors' decisions remains unclear, the move has not deterred analysts from their positive outlook on the company.  Brokerages like Sunidhi Research and Anand Rathi remain bullish on Arvind Fashions, predicting strong revenue and profit growth, and recommending the stock for long-term investment. \n\nThis situation highlights the importance of individual investment strategies and risk appetite. While the exit of prominent investors might cause some concern, the company's underlying fundamentals remain strong,  and the stock continues to attract positive sentiment from the market.\n\n**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

While some celebrate the arrival as the beginning of civilization in the region, others view it as a painful reminder of centuries of colonial oppression.\n\nThis year, the debate was reignited by Argentine President Javier Milei's statement that Columbus brought \"enlightenment\" to the Americas. This statement was met with fierce criticism from many Latin American leaders who see the event as a symbol of colonialism and the violent suppression of Indigenous cultures.\n\nMexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, vehemently refuted this perspective, highlighting the rich pre-Columbian cultures of the Americas. Sheinbaum, a leftist leader, has been vocal in demanding an apology from Spain for the atrocities committed during the conquest of Mexico. \n\nThe holiday itself has been subject to renamings and revisions in many Latin American countries, reflecting a shift in historical perspective.  Argentina, for instance, renamed the holiday from \u201cDay of the Race\u201d to \u201cDay of Respect for Cultural Diversity.\u201d  In Venezuela, the holiday is now called the \"Day of Indigenous Resistance.\"\n\nThe debate over Columbus' legacy is a complex and multifaceted one, highlighting the ongoing struggle to grapple with the history of colonization and its lasting impact on Latin America."

Potato and onion prices soared by 78.1% and 78.8%, respectively, while tomato prices increased by 74.5%. Although fruit and pulse prices eased marginally, they remained elevated at 12.2% and 13%, respectively.\n\nDespite the rise in food prices, the overall WPI increase was tempered by a decline in fuel and power prices, which fell over 4% from last September. Inflation for manufactured products also eased to 1%.\n\nEconomists expect WPI to rise further in October, citing increased oil and commodity prices, coupled with the expectation of continued elevated food price inflation.  The potential for further geopolitical conflict and China's economic stimulus, which has boosted global commodity prices, also contribute to this outlook."

        "news": "Hyundai Motor India's initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise \u20b927,856 crore, is set to hit the stock market on Tuesday. While the IPO is likely to see limited listing gains, analysts recommend a \"subscribe\" for long-term investors.\n\nThe grey market premium (GMP) has dropped significantly, indicating a potential lack of immediate upside. This is further supported by the muted performance of recent large IPOs like LIC and Paytm. Additionally, weak global market sentiment and rising competition in the Indian auto sector, with companies offering discounts, are contributing to the cautious outlook.\n\nDespite these challenges, analysts highlight Hyundai's strong financials, steady growth prospects, and a healthy SUV product slate as key drivers for long-term success. The company's recent expansion in manufacturing capacity, coupled with its focus on localizing parts, further strengthens its position.\n\nHyundai's valuation at the upper end of the price band (\u20b91,865-1,960) represents a 26 times EPS, 16.5 times EV/Ebitda, and 2.3 times price-to-sales ratio, slightly lower than industry leader Maruti Suzuki India. However, analysts believe the IPO is \"fully priced\" but recommend \"subscribe\" for long-term investors due to the company's robust future prospects.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* Limited listing gains are expected due to weak market sentiment and recent IPO performance.\n* Analysts recommend long-term investment due to Hyundai's strong financials, growth prospects, and expansion plans.\n* Hyundai's focus on localizing parts and its leadership in SUV sales are key strengths.\n* The IPO is considered \"fully priced\" but still attractive for long-term investors.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

In a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Satheesan criticized the government's decision to limit the number of daily pilgrims to 80,000, arguing that it would create unnecessary social tension and inconvenience.\n\nSatheesan pointed out that the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) previously allowed up to 90,000 devotees per day, including a significant number through spot booking. He expressed concern that the reliance on the online booking system would exclude pilgrims who lack computer literacy or access to online services, particularly tourists from other states.\n\nThe Communist Party of India (CPI), a key ally of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), echoed the concerns raised by the opposition. CPI State Secretary Binoy Viswam warned that the lack of spot booking could be exploited by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to create religious tensions and gain political mileage. He suggested a phased implementation of the online reservation system to avoid causing distress among devotees.\n\nThe Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president, K. Sudhakaran, also called for the restoration of spot booking and the removal of the daily pilgrim limit, highlighting the potential social consequences of the government's decision."

Indian companies like Bellatrix Aerospace, Pixxel, and SatSure are already developing and launching small satellites, capitalizing on the growing global demand for small-scale, cost-effective satellite technology.\n\nWhile competition from established space powers like the US, Russia, and China remains a challenge, India's strong software infrastructure and a thriving pool of data science and AI talent position it as a potential leader in the \"software play\" of the space downstream market. \n\nWith a projected $110.5 billion global small satellite industry by 2032, India aims to scale its solutions to South Asia and beyond to capture a significant share of this burgeoning market."

This resulted in a notional loss of Rs 20,800 crore for Radhakishan Damani and other promoters who collectively hold a 74.65% stake in the company. \n\nAnalysts attribute the decline to mounting competition from online grocery platforms, especially in major cities, which has impacted DMart's sales.

While some brokerages like Centrum Broking remain bullish, others have downgraded DMart's stock rating to 'Hold' or 'Reduce'.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* DMart shares fell by over 9% on Monday, impacting promoters by Rs 20,800 crore.\n* Q2 results showed a slowdown in revenue growth and LFL growth.\n* Competition from online grocery platforms is a major concern.\n* Analysts have revised their earnings projections and ratings for DMart."

Despite this shift, the country's unwavering support for Ukraine and its focus on bolstering defence spending are expected to remain unchanged.\n\nWhile the Social Democrats are leading in polls, with an estimated 20% of the vote, the ruling Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats are projected to secure around 15%. A new populist party, whose leader is facing trial for alleged anti-Semitic comments, could also gain a seat in parliament for the first time.\n\nDespite the potential for a new government, Lithuania's foreign policy stance is not expected to alter significantly.  The country's commitment to supporting Ukraine and increasing defence spending, currently at 3% of GDP, is widely agreed upon by all major parties. President Gitanas Nauseda, who won a second term in May with backing from the Social Democrats, is believed to be supportive of a change in government.\n\nAs a NATO and EU member bordering Russia, Lithuania has been closely watching the war in Ukraine and is concerned about potential Russian aggression. The election results are likely to further solidify the country's commitment to its pro-Ukraine stance and bolster its defence capabilities."

This practice, prevalent among the Amazigh tribes, known as Berbers, served as a powerful symbol of identity, beauty, and protection.\n\nThe tattoos, often applied to the chin, forehead, or hands, varied in design between different tribes. They held cultural significance, signifying a woman's origin, while also expressing her individual beauty and independence.\n\nHowever, changing religious attitudes in recent decades have led to a decline in the practice. The influence of interpretations of Islam, which prohibit inked skin and other body modifications, has contributed to the fading of this tradition. \n\nFurthermore, social pressure from fundamentalist groups, who view tattoos as \"the devil's book\" or \"the first thing to be burned on the human body,\" has led some women to remove their tattoos, fearing punishment after death. \n\nThis cultural shift highlights the impact of religious beliefs on traditional practices, leaving a void in the cultural landscape of the Amazigh people."

This marked the fifth test flight of the Starship rocket, designed for lunar and Martian missions.  \n\nThe 20-story-tall Super Heavy booster, after launching the Starship into space, returned to Earth and was caught by the launch tower's arms, a feat hailed as a significant engineering accomplishment. \n\nThe tower, taller than the Statue of Liberty, features two large metal arms designed to grasp the booster as it descends. The arms successfully caught the rocket by securing it with small bars under the booster's steering fins. \n\nThis successful capture marks a crucial step in SpaceX's ambition to develop a fully reusable rocket for future space missions. \n\nThe Starship, meanwhile, reached a height of 89 miles before splashing down in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia. While the landing was successful, the Starship later tipped over and exploded, though it's unclear if this was intentional or due to a fuel leak. \n\nDespite the Starship explosion, the successful booster capture signifies SpaceX's progress toward its goal of reusable rockets capable of transporting people and cargo to destinations like the moon and Mars."

Araghchi emphasized that Iran is not seeking war but will not be intimidated.\n\nThe current situation highlights the fragile peace in the region, with tensions mounting between Israel and Hezbollah, who are backed by Iran.  Netanyahu's call for UNIFIL's withdrawal underscores the complexities of the situation and raises concerns about the safety of peacekeepers caught in the crossfire."
