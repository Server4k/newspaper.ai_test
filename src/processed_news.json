        "news": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman has defended the company's new mandatory five-day in-office work policy, starting in January 2025.  He stated at an all-hands meeting that the policy aims to foster a collaborative environment and drive innovation, claiming that remote work hinders these goals.\n\nGarman acknowledged that some employees may not be comfortable with the new policy, and for them, he delivered a blunt message: \"If there are people who just don\u2019t work well in that environment and don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s okay, there are other companies around.\"\n\nGarman cited the company's difficulty in innovating remotely as the primary reason for the change. He believes that the previous three-day in-office policy wasn't effective, stating that the \"ability for us to really, really innovate on interesting products\" is hindered by remote work. He also pointed out that Amazon's leadership principles are harder to apply in a remote work setting.\n\nThe new policy has faced criticism from some employees who argue that commuting is a waste of time and that the benefits of in-office work aren't backed by data. Reports suggest that some employees who didn't comply with the existing three-day policy were told they were \"voluntarily resigning\" and had their access to company systems revoked.\n\nDespite the backlash, Garman remains optimistic about the change, stating that he's \"quite excited about this.\" Amazon's return-to-office policy is stricter than many other tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which have adopted more flexible policies requiring two to three days of in-office work."

(HZL) is set to release its Q2 FY25 earnings on Friday, October 18th, with analysts expecting strong year-on-year (YoY) growth, driven by higher zinc and silver prices. While quarterly comparisons (QoQ) are projected to be muted, HZL is poised to benefit from expanded margins and higher sales volumes.\n\nBrokerages anticipate significant jumps in net profit, Ebitda and revenue compared to last year. Nuvama Institutional Equities forecasts revenue of Rs 8,026 crore, up 18% YoY, while Motilal Oswal expects sales around Rs 7,800 crore, representing a 15% YoY increase. Kotak Institutional Equities projects revenue at Rs 7,985 crore, a 18% YoY rise.\n\nAll analysts highlight the positive impact of higher zinc and silver prices on HZL's performance. Nuvama expects lower zinc-lead prices to be offset by increased silver volume and reduced cost of production.  Kotak anticipates zinc, lead and silver sales to grow by 7%, 10.5%, and 1.7% YoY, respectively.\n\nThe dividend announcement and any updates regarding corporate structure changes are key aspects investors will be watching. \n\nWhile analysts generally foresee strong YoY earnings, the outlook for QoQ performance remains uncertain. Further insights on cost of production, volumes and realizations will provide crucial context for the company's future trajectory."

In June 2022, Khan received a handwritten note threatening him with the same fate as singer Sidhu Moose Wala, who was also murdered by the gang. \n\nFollowing the threats, Khan has taken security measures including purchasing a bulletproof car and requesting the extradition of Bishnoi gang members from Canada.

While revenue growth was solid, with early signs of a rebound in discretionary spending, margins and deal wins fell short of expectations. \n\nThe company raised its FY25 revenue guidance to 3.75-4.5% in constant currency terms, but maintained its EBIT margin guidance at 20-22%. This suggests cautious optimism about the future, but potential challenges in profitability. \n\nAnalysts remain cautiously positive. While some, like Nuvama Institutional Equities, are maintaining their \"Buy\" rating, others, like Nirmal Bang, are suggesting a \"Hold\". The key point of contention is the company's lower-than-expected deal wins and margins, especially in the face of increasing competition. \n\nDespite challenges, Infosys is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities, particularly in Financial Services. The company's expertise in cloud technology and generative AI provides a competitive edge in the evolving IT landscape.\n\n**Overall, Infosys shares remain a complex investment. While the long-term outlook remains positive, the short-term uncertainty necessitates careful consideration and thorough analysis before making any investment decisions.**"

This follows North Korea's recent constitutional amendment formally labeling the South as an adversary and the destruction of border infrastructure connecting the two nations. \n\nKim's pronouncements mark a significant shift away from past reconciliation efforts and reflect his desire to escalate tensions, potentially as a tactic to gain leverage in stalled diplomatic negotiations. While analysts acknowledge the heightened risk of border clashes, they deem a full-scale attack highly unlikely due to the superior military capabilities of the US and South Korea. \n\nThe North Korean leader has also been increasingly vocal about his nuclear arsenal, threatening to use it against the South and the US. These escalating tensions are further fuelled by North Korea's recent missile tests, which have prompted joint military drills involving the US, South Korea, and Japan.\n\nThis aggressive stance coincides with speculation that North Korea might further escalate provocations ahead of the US presidential elections in November, seeking to garner attention from Washington. Potential actions could include a long-range missile launch or even a nuclear test."

Biden attributed Sinwar's death to the combined efforts of U.S. intelligence and the Israel Defense Forces. He emphasized that Israel had the right to eliminate terrorists and that Sinwar was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, and citizens from over 30 countries during the October 7th attack on Israel. \n\nBiden said the killing of Sinwar, who he described as the mastermind behind the \"massacres, rapes, and kidnappings,\" marked an opportunity for peace in Gaza. He acknowledged that much work remains to achieve a lasting political settlement, but he believes the removal of Sinwar is a crucial step toward a future without Hamas."

        "news": "Mumbai's ambitious infrastructure projects, while aiming to elevate the city to world-class standards, are facing strong opposition from residents and activists. Concerns center around disregard for environmental regulations and a lack of inclusive planning, particularly impacting fishing communities.\n\nFisherfolk in areas like Gavhan, Uran, and Gorai are experiencing shrinking fishing grounds and the destruction of vital mangrove ecosystems due to projects like the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), and Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA).  \n\nThe depletion of mangroves, essential for coastal protection and fishing livelihoods, has sparked widespread anger.  Fisherfolk, who rely on these ecosystems for their survival, fear displacement and the loss of their ancestral lands.  The construction of the Madh Island-Versova flyover, for instance, has led to the clearing of mangroves and encroaches upon residential areas, raising concerns about the well-being of local communities.\n\nThe plight of the Uran Koliwada community exemplifies the struggle.  The once pristine Uran creek now reeks of chemicals and sewage, depleted of fish.  The residents were even arrested in February 2023 for protesting the Uran Bypass Road construction, highlighting the disregard for their concerns.\n\nWhile the government cites increased mangrove cover in the state, critics argue that the focus on development comes at the expense of ecological preservation and the well-being of fishing communities. The question remains: is Mumbai's modernization truly inclusive and sustainable, or does it come at the cost of its most vulnerable residents?"

They argue that the residents of Delhi have become accustomed to the subsidized services provided by the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, including electricity, water, and free bus rides for women.\n\nThe BJP's campaign currently focuses on highlighting the AAP government's perceived failures and promoting a \"double-engine government\" \u2013 a unified ruling party at both the national and state levels. However, party sources believe that to effectively compete with the AAP, the BJP must address the issue of subsidies, potentially offering similar benefits to gain voter support.\n\nThe 2020 and 2015 Assembly elections saw the BJP fail to secure a majority, and the party is determined to improve its performance in the upcoming election.  While acknowledging that the BJP will likely win seats in the double-digits, party strategists believe that to achieve a majority, they need to reassure voters that their subsidies will remain under a BJP-led government."

This detection process can only be initiated by the state, and according to Justice Pardiwala, Section 6A lacks any provision for self-declaration or voluntary identification as a foreigner.  \n\nThis situation, according to Justice Pardiwala,  effectively allows undocumented immigrants to remain in Assam indefinitely, with no time limit for the state to detect them. They are also eligible to vote until their status is officially declared, and thus enjoy the benefits of de facto citizenship.  He further criticized the arbitrary nature of the 10-year removal from electoral rolls following detection, arguing it contradicts the stated goal of expedited detection, deportation, and eventual citizenship. \n\nIn his dissent, Justice Pardiwala concluded that Section 6A and its associated benefits should not be extended to immigrants in Assam from the date of this judgement."

They cite concerns including:\n\n* **Work-Life Balance:**  Europe's stricter labor laws offer more job security and less pressure compared to India's often demanding work culture.\n* **Quality of Life:**  Issues like air and water pollution, corruption, and challenges in healthcare and government services were cited as deterrents.\n* **Leave Policies:**  Extended leave is more readily available in Europe, while securing even a short break in India can be difficult.\n\nWhile some acknowledged that personal circumstances could influence the decision, the majority emphasized the benefits of stability, work-life balance, and overall quality of life in Europe over Bengaluru."

The FIR includes charges under sections 196, 223, 299, and 302 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (Indian Penal Code). \n\nJandel maintains the video is edited, while the BJP claims the incident is part of the Congress's \"nefarious agenda to wipe out Sanatan from the country,\" urging the party to take action against their MLA. \n\nThe bypoll in Vijaypur, along with the Budhni Assembly seat, is scheduled for November 20th.

The procedure was unique due to the connection of the donor kidney's arteries directly to the recipient's aorta, the largest artery in the body. This approach was necessary because of the patient's pre-existing vascular blockages, which typically make transplant surgery too risky.\n\nTraditionally, kidney transplants connect the donor kidney's arteries to the recipient's iliac vessels. However, patients with severe arterial blockages were previously considered unfit for transplantation. This breakthrough procedure allows a larger pool of patients with kidney failure to receive life-saving treatment.\n\nThe surgical team at SIMS Institute of Urology and Renal Transplantation successfully connected the arteries, enabling the patient to receive a healthy kidney. One year after the transplant, the patient is reported to have excellent renal function and overall health. This successful case marks a significant advancement in kidney transplantation, offering hope to patients with vascular blockages who were previously excluded from this life-saving procedure."

This exception, present in both the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), has been challenged by petitioners who argue it violates women's fundamental right to bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity. \n\nThe court, in its initial hearing, raised serious questions about the rationale behind this exemption. Justice J.B. Pardiwala pointed out the legal inconsistency of punishing acts of confinement, intimidation, and assault preceding forced sexual intercourse, yet exempting the act itself when committed by a husband.\n\nChief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud highlighted the absurdity of allowing forced insertion of objects by strangers to be considered rape, but excluding the same act by a husband. He questioned the government's argument that criminalizing marital rape would threaten the institution of marriage, emphasizing that protecting women from rape within marriage does not equate to destroying the institution itself.\n\nThe petitioners, represented by senior advocate Karuna Nundy, argued that the exemption is discriminatory and violates constitutional values. They emphasized that marital status should not grant immunity from rape charges and that a woman's autonomy and dignity are paramount, even within marriage.  \n\nThe Supreme Court will continue its hearings, with the possibility of referring the case to a larger bench for a more comprehensive constitutional examination. This case is significant in its potential to redefine the legal framework surrounding consent and sexual violence within marriage, ultimately impacting the lives of countless women in India."

The court stressed that the Registrar's actions in receiving petitions under Sections 94 or 95 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, do not involve any judicial function.\n\nThis decision stemmed from an appeal filed by Buoyant Technology Constellations Pvt. Ltd. challenging a single judge's ruling that had quashed the company's resolution process. The single judge argued that non-maintainable petitions should be rejected at the registration stage to prevent the automatic interim moratorium from coming into effect against the respondent.\n\nHowever, the High Court disagreed, stating that the automatic moratorium provision does not grant the Registrar the power to assess petition maintainability.  The court emphasized that the NCLT's adjudicating authority, not the Registrar, is responsible for examining maintainability under Sections 96 to 100 of the code."

He highlighted that the residents of Wayanad have not seen any significant benefits from electing Gandhi as their MP, suggesting that voters are becoming increasingly aware of this.\n\nRamesh questioned why the Congress party couldn't identify a candidate outside the Gandhi family for Wayanad, implying a lack of leadership within the party.

However, the observatory successfully captured images on Wednesday, October 16, marking a significant achievement for the region's observational astronomy. \n\nComet C/2023 A3 is currently traversing the Orion constellation and is expected to remain visible for the next three days. As it moves further away from the sun, its brightness will decrease, making this a fleeting opportunity for skywatchers. While it has been described as the brightest comet in over a decade, it is not expected to reach the iconic brilliance of Comet Hale-Bopp, which dazzled observers in 1997.\n\nThe observatory welcomes the public to view the comet during its open hours, from 6 pm onwards, weather permitting."

This upward revision is attributed to the ramp-up of mega deals and the company's increasing focus on generative AI solutions.\n\nWhile Infosys added 2,500 employees in the September quarter, marking an end to six consecutive quarters of staff reduction, the company maintained its EBIT margin guidance for the fiscal year at 20% to 22%.\n\nThe positive news is a boost for Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who has been vocal about the company's performance in recent years."

        "news": "The Rights, Equity, and Environment Protection (REEP) Foundation, based in Bengaluru, is taking the lead in cleaning up the Kallai River in Kozhikode, Kerala. The initiative comes after a report from the Central Pollution Control Board declared the river, which runs through the city center, as the most polluted in Kerala.\n\nREEP Foundation will collaborate with the District Administration, Kozhikode Corporation, and other stakeholders to develop a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the clean-up. This includes a 30-year plan for the river\u2019s revitalization. \n\nThe project faces several challenges, including widespread pollution from various sources:\n\n* **Industrial Waste:**  Closed industrial units and dumping of waste materials on the riverbanks are a major source of contamination.\n* **Timber Industry:** Timber dumping and outdated seasoning practices contribute to water quality degradation.\n* **Coconut Husk Processing:** The disposal of coconut husks for coir fiber production pollutes the river.\n* **Encroachment:**  Large-scale encroachment of revenue land and unsurrendered lease properties by private entities further exacerbate the issue.\n\nPrevious efforts by the River Protection Council have not yielded significant results. The REEP Foundation hopes to bring together stakeholders to develop a comprehensive and effective plan to restore the Kallai River to a healthy state."

The court cited Haroon's extended period of detention, his lack of previous criminal record, and the need to establish his role in the crime during the trial.\n\nSanjith was attacked and killed on November 15, 2021, while travelling with his wife. The prosecution alleges that Haroon and five other accused, members of the now-banned Popular Front of India (PFI), were involved in the attack due to political animosity.\n\nThe court acknowledged that Haroon was a member of the PFI, but noted that the organization was not banned at the time of the crime. Therefore, his membership alone does not warrant continued incarceration. The court further emphasized that it is the prosecution's responsibility to prove his specific role in the murder during the trial."
