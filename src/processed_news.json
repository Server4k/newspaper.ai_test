        "news": "A recent post on X sparked a debate about the modesty of IIT alumni. IIT Roorkee graduate Jay Modi (@jay_modi6) shared a story of a man who downplayed his IIT Kanpur background, leading Modi to jokingly call IITians the \"most modest creatures out there.\" This humorous observation resonated with users who shared their own experiences with unassuming IIT graduates.\n\nAuthor Ankur Warikoo joined the conversation with a story about a seemingly ordinary young man he met on a flight. The man, an IIT and IIM graduate working at Hindustan Unilever, never bragged about his prestigious background, leaving Warikoo initially assuming he was from a smaller company. This encounter highlighted the potential for assumptions to cloud our perceptions and underscored the idea of modesty in the face of accomplishment. \n\nHowever, other users pointed out that not all IITians are equally modest, with some noting that those who chose less sought-after branches might be more likely to downplay their IIT affiliation. Ultimately, the debate highlights the complexity of modesty and the potential for both humor and introspection when discussing educational achievements."

        "news": "The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) surged 3% in September 2024, marking the largest monthly increase since March 2022. This sharp rise has put India's Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on high alert. \n\nThe FFPI, which tracks international food commodity prices, has been steadily increasing since January 2024. The ongoing Israel-West Asia conflict has exacerbated the situation, disrupting global supply chains and pushing prices higher. This is particularly worrying for India, which heavily relies on imports for key food commodities like vegetable oils and wheat.\n\nThe recent spike in the FFPI threatens India's inflation management strategy, which is already grappling with a projected rise in Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation to 4.7% in the October-December quarter. The RBI had previously anticipated a decline in global food prices, allowing for a more accommodative monetary policy. However, the current trend necessitates a re-evaluation of that stance.\n\nThe upcoming RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting will be closely watched for any changes to its inflation projections and interest rate policy in light of this global development."

He describes the constant pressure as akin to working in a call center, impacting his mental and physical health.  He also alleges that many of these calls focus on his perceived failure to meet targets, leading him to feel demoralized. \n\nThis is not an isolated case. In May, a video went viral of a Canara Bank manager berating employees during a Zoom meeting, emphasizing that their primary focus should be the bank, even at the expense of personal life. \n\nThe employee, a manager in his 30s, describes his daily duties, which include managing HNI accounts, overseeing operations, promoting financial products, and handling legacy loan cases,  including attending court hearings and calling borrowers.  The relentless pressure from superiors and the constant demands for performance improvement are taking a toll on his well-being."

This has led to a significant reduction in margins, with A23 now operating at close to zero profit.\n\nGullapalli expressed hope that the government will consider a review, citing the industry's commitment to responsible gaming and self-regulation. He believes that whitelisting legitimate gaming platforms would benefit both consumers and the industry.\n\nThe online gaming industry is seeking a dialogue with the government to address the impact of the 28% GST, hoping for a rate reduction or other measures to support the sector's growth."

He blames his absence on a sponsorship deal between the show and his main competitor, Swiggy. \n\nGoyal, a popular judge in the previous season, said he was \"kicked out\" due to the Swiggy sponsorship. He explained that he had joined the show to provide realistic insights into the startup world, but the sponsorship deal prevents him from returning.  \n\nThe Zomato chief also reflected on the rivalry with Swiggy, recalling a particularly challenging moment in 2018. During that year, Swiggy raised $1 billion in funding while Zomato struggled with just $35 million in the bank. Goyal admitted, \"That was the only time I thought, 'Oh sh**, we\u2019re dead.'\" \n\nDespite the competitive landscape, Goyal remains pragmatic about Swiggy's growth and upcoming IPO, recently approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). \n\nWhile the two companies compete fiercely in the food delivery and quick commerce sectors, both acknowledge the benefits of having each other as strong competitors. Goyal believes that the rivalry pushes them to continuously innovate and improve. \n\nWith Goyal out of Shark Tank and the quick commerce market expanding, the stage is set for an even more intense rivalry between Zomato and Swiggy, not just in food delivery but across the entire Indian tech landscape."

Reliance plans to leverage its vast retail network, including Reliance Digital and Trends stores, to fulfill orders, unlike its competitors who rely on dark stores and warehouses.  \n\nThe company aims to deliver most orders within 10-15 minutes, utilizing its logistics arm Grab for fulfillment. This strategy allows Reliance to avoid building new infrastructure, distinguishing it from its rivals. \n\nFurthermore, Reliance plans to offer free delivery, platform fees, and surge charges, placing it at a cost advantage over competitors like Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart. The company aims to expand its service to 1,150 cities across 5,000 pin codes by the end of the month.\n\nThis move comes as the quick commerce market experiences rapid growth, with platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart outperforming traditional FMCG giants like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Marico. This competitive landscape highlights the potential of the quick commerce sector to reshape consumer habits. \n\nReliance's entry into this market with its aggressive approach is expected to intensify competition, particularly in the fast-moving consumer goods sector, where quick commerce has become a significant growth channel."

Researchers analyzed data from the recently discovered asteroid swarm in the Kuiper Belt, finding that the swarm is far less dense than previously thought. This means the likelihood of a catastrophic impact on Earth is significantly lower than initial estimates. \n\nThe study focused on analyzing the trajectory and composition of the asteroid swarm. The researchers used advanced simulations and sophisticated modeling techniques to determine the swarm's density and potential impact risks. Their findings indicate that the swarm is primarily composed of small, low-mass asteroids that pose little threat to Earth. \n\nThis reassurance is welcome news as the initial discovery of the swarm had sparked concerns about a potential apocalyptic event. While the threat remains, it is now considered significantly less probable, offering a sigh of relief to those worried about the potential dangers of asteroid impacts."

One user, who has resided in Delhi for 13 years, stated, \"Been in Delhi from last 13 years, never faced discrimination, never saw anyone doing discrimination based on language. Delhi dilwalon ki hai\" (Delhi belongs to those with big hearts).\n\nHowever, some users did acknowledge that communication difficulties might exist, but they attributed them to general linguistic barriers, not necessarily a deliberate exclusion of non-Punjabi speakers. \n\nThe controversy highlights a complex issue: the role of language in shaping social interactions and perceptions of belonging in diverse cities like Delhi. It also raises questions about the extent to which individual experiences can be generalized to represent the entire city's attitude."

        "news": "India's Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has assured the nation that there is no anticipated shortage of crude oil supply, despite a recent 13% surge in Brent crude prices. This surge was triggered by heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, leading to fears of potential disruptions to oil production and supply.\n\nWhile India currently imports 88% of its oil needs from 39 countries, making it vulnerable to market fluctuations, the government remains optimistic. Minister Puri points to the current global oil surplus and the availability of alternative suppliers.\n\nExperts, however, warn of potential disruptions if tensions escalate. A full-blown conflict could see Iran block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping route, leading to severe supply disruptions and price hikes.\n\nHowever, analysts believe both Israel and Iran are unlikely to escalate the situation into an all-out war due to the significant consequences. The recent price spike is attributed to heightened tensions and is expected to stabilize in the coming weeks.\n\nFurther contributing to the calming of the market, the Indian basket of crude oil has shown a steady decline since April, with prices averaging $78.27 per barrel in August. This, along with the expected stabilization of Brent prices, suggests that petrol and diesel prices in India will remain unchanged."

        "news": "India's retail inflation, after dropping below 4% for two consecutive months in July and August, is expected to climb back up to 5% in September. This is driven by several factors:\n\n* **High Vegetable Prices:**  Continued high vegetable prices are a key contributor.  The cost of a home-cooked vegetable thali has risen by 11% year-on-year, with onions, potatoes, and tomatoes experiencing significant price hikes due to supply chain disruptions.\n* **Rising Core Inflation:** Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, is also predicted to rise. This is attributed to increased rural demand, festive season spending, and elevated gold prices.\n* **Seasonal Factors:** While vegetable prices usually see a downward trend in the second half of the year due to fresh harvests, disruptions in supply and weather factors have led to price spikes.\n\nAnalysts expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to maintain its repo rate at 6.5% for the tenth consecutive meeting, despite concerns about inflation. While the RBI's stance on inflation seems to be softening, they remain cautious about potential spillovers to core inflation. \n\nOfficial data on CPI inflation for September will be released on October 14."

The video, which shows two men assisting an elderly man with a white beard and a walking stick, was met with skepticism from fact-checkers. \n\nInvestigations revealed the man in the video is not 188 years old but Siyaram Baba, a Hindu saint from Madhya Pradesh, who is around 110 years old. Fact-checking organizations, including D-Intent Data, confirmed this, noting that the video and age claim are misleading. \n\nThe viral post on X was flagged with a disclaimer, stating that the man is Siyaram Baba and approximately 110 years old.  News reports from July 2024, including one from Navbharat Times, also confirmed Siyaram Baba's identity and age. \n\nDespite the video's popularity, the 188-year-old claim has been debunked. Experts have warned of the increasing trend of influencers sharing exaggerated and unverified content for attention.  D-Intent Data urged users to be wary of such claims, highlighting the manipulative tactics used by some influencers to gain social media visibility."

This surge, fueled by foreign investment in Indian stocks and bonds, makes India's reserves the fourth largest in the world. \n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has actively utilized these reserves to stabilize the rupee, preventing extreme fluctuations amid a near-record low. This strategic move provides the RBI with greater leverage to manage the rupee's performance, with analysts predicting reserves could reach $745 billion by March 2026. \n\nThe buildup in reserves is supported by a balance-of-payments surplus and a narrowing current-account deficit. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has emphasized the importance of maintaining this forex buffer to protect the economy from market volatility.\n\nDespite the positive developments, global tensions, particularly in the Middle East, pose risks to India's economy. Rising oil prices due to the conflict could disrupt oil supply and influence global interest rate decisions. While the Indian economy shows resilience, external risks and inflationary pressures remain. \n\nThe RBI is expected to approach future policy decisions cautiously, monitoring food and fuel prices closely as inflation continues to decline."

He confirmed his sister's safety and reassured his mother, but the distress had already taken a toll on her health.\n\nUpon returning home from school, Malti Verma fell ill and was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. The incident has highlighted the increasing problem of \"digital arrest\" scams, with cybercriminals using fear tactics to extort money.\n\nAuthorities are investigating the call and will take action against the perpetrator."

In the video, Naik, who is wanted in India on charges of terror-related activities, refuses to accept flowers and a memento from the girls, citing Islamic principles that he believes prevent him from interacting with them.\n\nAccording to sources, Naik, who is in Pakistan on a lecture tour, became visibly angry after the orphanage administrator referred to the girls as \"daughters.\" He argued that the girls, deemed to be of marriageable age, should not be called \"daughters\" and should instead be married off as soon as possible.\n\nThis incident has further fueled criticism of Naik's controversial views and his presence in Pakistan, a country that has been vocal in its condemnation of extremism and violence.  India has strongly condemned Naik's visit, calling it \"disappointing and condemnable,\" while Malaysia, where Naik has been residing since fleeing India, has indicated its willingness to cooperate with Indian authorities if sufficient evidence is presented against him."

But amidst the hype, separating science from marketing is crucial. \n\n**The Science:**\n\nWegovy, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, is FDA-approved for chronic weight management in adults with obesity. Clinical trials show significant weight loss (up to 15%) compared to placebo.  It works by mimicking the effects of a naturally occurring hormone that regulates appetite and glucose levels.\n\n**The Hype:**\n\nWhile effective, Wegovy isn't a magic bullet.  Concerns about potential side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with high cost and limited availability, fuel the hype.  \n\n**The Unverified:**\n\nReports of people \"microdosing\" Ozempic (a similar medication) for weight loss without medical advice are alarming. Doctors warn against this practice, emphasizing the importance of personalized treatment plans.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\n\nWegovy holds promise for those struggling with obesity, but understanding its limitations and potential risks is crucial.  Always consult with your doctor before considering any weight-loss medication."

Conversely, Bharat Electron, BHEL, Torrent Power, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, and SAIL are listed as top \"Sell\" suggestions."

This claim garnered significant attention, particularly given the company's young age, having been incorporated just weeks prior. \n\nHowever, despite initial media buzz, inconsistencies and unanswered questions have emerged surrounding the company's alleged funding. Notably, a parallel claim of $100 million investment by SRAM & MRAM Group in SpiceXpress, the cargo division of SpiceJet, has been debunked. A SpiceJet spokesperson confirmed that no such investment has materialized.\n\nAdding to the mystery, Zyber 365's co-founder Sunny Piyushkumar Vaghela resigned this year, citing lack of progress on product development, funding, and strategic implementation.  Vaghela's resignation letter also requests removal of his name and TechDefence's address from the company's website.\n\nDespite claiming to be a leading multinational conglomerate, Zyber 365's website offers little concrete information about its operations. Moreover, no financial reports have been filed with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs since the company's incorporation.\n\nWhile Kapur maintains a strong social media presence, he has not responded to inquiries regarding the funding claims. Similarly, SRAM & MRAM Group has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe lack of transparency and inconsistencies surrounding Zyber 365's alleged funding raise serious questions about the validity of its claimed unicorn status. The situation highlights the importance of due diligence and critical analysis when evaluating startup claims, particularly in a rapidly evolving industry like Web 3.0."

While the details of the accident are unclear, the incident has prompted discussion about the safety features of the vehicle involved and whether a higher safety rating could have prevented or mitigated the impact of the crash. \n\nConsumers are encouraged to research the safety ratings of cars before making a purchase. Organizations like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the US and Euro NCAP in Europe provide comprehensive safety ratings for vehicles based on rigorous testing.  \n\nThe recent accident highlights the importance of prioritizing safety features in vehicles, and encourages drivers to be aware of the safety ratings of their cars."

The thread, initiated by user \"pranagrapher,\" garnered over 5,700 upvotes and countless comments detailing various encounters with overly inquisitive managers. \n\nMany responses described managers questioning the legitimacy of illnesses, even going so far as to suggest alternative medications.  One user recounted being asked by their manager if they could postpone menstrual leave due to a heavy workload, while another was accused of faking a 102\u00b0 fever.  Another user was asked to provide medical documents after using company insurance for dengue treatment, while another was told to take sick leave before it \"lapsed\" the following year. \n\nThe thread's discussion reflects a larger issue of employers questioning employee's genuine need for sick leave, leading to a culture of fear and pressure to work while ill. This issue is particularly prevalent in India, where work-life balance and employee well-being are often overlooked. The thread serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting employees' health and privacy, and the need for employers to implement more supportive and understanding sick leave policies."

        "news": "Electric vehicle sales in India have seen a significant increase in the first six months of the year, rising by 25% compared to the same period last year. A total of 800,000 electric vehicles were sold, with two-wheelers contributing the most to this growth.  \n\nWhile the overall EV market saw a healthy jump, electric car sales only increased by a modest 1.3%. This suggests that the growth is primarily driven by the increasing popularity of electric two-wheelers.\n\nExperts believe the upcoming festive season will be crucial in determining the future trajectory of the EV market. They anticipate a surge in demand, with the true impact of the recent growth becoming clearer in October."

        "news": "Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has expressed concern over the potential exclusion of food prices from inflation calculations. He argues that doing so would erode public trust in the central bank's ability to manage inflation effectively. \n\nRajan highlights the significant impact of food prices on Indian households, which constitute nearly half of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket. He emphasizes that while the RBI may not be able to influence short-term food price fluctuations, sustained food inflation indicates underlying structural issues requiring the central bank's attention.\n\nThis cautionary note comes amidst ongoing discussions about recalibrating the CPI basket to reflect modern consumption patterns and the potential to reduce the weight of food prices. While some argue that excluding food inflation from benchmark interest rate considerations is justified due to its volatility and limited control by monetary policy, Rajan maintains that food inflation cannot be dismissed.\n\nHis concern stems from the potential for a disconnect between official inflation figures and the reality of rising food prices, leading to a loss of public confidence in the central bank's statements. Rajan draws parallels to past periods when the RBI focused on the Producer Price Index (PPI) \u2013 a measure that failed to resonate with public experiences of inflation. \n\nThe article underscores the crucial role of food inflation in India's inflation dynamics, particularly in comparison to developed countries where its impact is less pronounced. The RBI faces the challenge of balancing food and core inflation to maintain public trust in its inflation management strategy."

This move, prompted by anticipated revenue decline from the derivative segment, signifies a shift away from zero-brokerage models.\n\nThe new fee structure comes as regulatory changes, including measures to curb derivative market frenzy, increase transaction costs and potentially lower trading volumes. Industry experts believe that the increased costs will make it difficult for brokerages, especially discount platforms, to maintain their current fee structures.\n\nThis shift is driven by a recent Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) directive mandating uniform transaction levies for brokers and customers.  This regulation could reduce brokerage income by \u20b92,000 crore, significantly impacting discount platforms that heavily rely on derivative market revenue.\n\nWhile Zerodha, another prominent brokerage, has yet to announce a fee change, its founder Nithin Kamath has acknowledged the potential for a significant revenue hit due to stricter derivative trading rules.\n\nThe move signals an end to the era of free or heavily discounted brokerage services, forcing a reevaluation of pricing models by both large and small brokerage firms."
